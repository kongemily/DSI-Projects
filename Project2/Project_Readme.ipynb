    "### Emily Kong, DSI-14-Singapore\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "This project sets out to identify as accurate a model as possible for Ames housing sale prices using the historical sales prices and corresponding information, using regression techniques, enhanced by applications of feature engineering, feature selection and regularisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary \n",
    "The train data set provided contains information for more than 2900 properties. The data dictionary below outlines the descriptive variables provided in the data, of which some are :-\n",
    "- nominal (categorical) meaning it takes qualitative values representing different categories;\n",
    "- ordinal(categorical) which provides an order of choices;\n",
    "- discrete(numerical) which are at set intervals\n",
    "- continuous(numerical) which can take any value (such as square feet).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set was further divided into two datasets, one of which saleprices (training data) are provided to be used for modelling purposes, after which the selected features and models are used for the prediction of the sale prices on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process involved cleaning and editing of the training data such as:-\n",
    "- Filling of null or missing values\n",
    "- One-hot encoding of nominal variables\n",
    "- Mapping of ordinal variables to numerical categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the box plots of the variables against sale prices, certain variables were dropped according to the lack of pattern and low correlation against saleprice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using sklearn's Regression methods, the performance of the respective models can be evaluated via the R2 score which represents the squared area around the best line of fit. The higher the score, the better prediction abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "There was minimal feature engineering involved due to the large set of variables already provided and upon applying the PolynomialFeatures method, the variables increased to 17000 columns after generating all the possible combinations, of which many were highly collinear and proved to be time consuming for elimination.  This method was deemed not feasible therefore based on the data provided, some interactions between variables were added and variables which were combined as an additional variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using GridsearchCV to iterate through the combination of hyper parameters, GridSearch was able find the optimal alpha and L1 ratio for the best performance of ElasticNet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, first two datasets were provided and 1 Kaggle submission file was submitted online:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Train]('../datasets/train.csv')\n",
    "- [Test]('../datasets/test.csv')\n",
    "- [kaggle_submission]('../datasets/kaggle_submission.csv')\n",
