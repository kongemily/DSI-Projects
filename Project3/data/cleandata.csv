awesomescorpion,performance horror story c solved single character days optimise blindly,mods inappropriate subreddit feel free take wanted share beginner since mistake expect beginners c like easily make find hard track especially coming higher level language like python experience drill head always check something reference copy well never blindly optimise seems appropriate r learnprogramming people learning program c also first actual project c please kind stupid mistake warning ahead time bit wall text talking stuff little bit closer metal beginners familiar least try keep simple high concept level fundamental issue mean need talk memory management little bit hope explain concept simple enough follow along even never worked language manual memory management also talk thing better rather code hope people take heart great practice speed development anything work future including languages work much higher level set scene young foolishly optimistic beginner developer tries hand crafting voxel world using extremely useful free online guide swear ad guide super good highly recommend anyone else interested opengl c gets pretty far pretty quickly cube front rendered beautifully th try satisfied confident skills reaches skies renders two cubes time still rendering beautifully x point framerate starts fall answer clearly available tutorials say construct vbo multiple objects render whole collection one go rather one cube time shenanigans solution easily tracked x scene rendered fast beautifully overconfident developer scales x x x framerate dropping reached gpu limit cubes world total vertices render much everyone online says modern gpu render billions vertices half million trivial must cpu problem profiler say cpu bottleneck code ran every frame relatively simple auto mesh meshes mesh draw shader note meshes vector contains single mesh object simply manages vao vbo scene stores copy floats amounting mb raw gpu sent setup sending vertex data every frame saw ahead time bad idea subtle know c well already understand exactly getting fps amounts simple scene coming python idea causing cpu slow rather take closer look cpu profiler data took stupid headed approach manually searching codebase optimization problems side track another beginner type performance mistake c started track possible issues one thing encountered storing block data struct like struct block glm vec position std string type usage example block grassblock block position grass pro tip use strings high quantity often copied objects replacing enum class types blocks massively sped load times copying strings expensive allocate much memory simple int performs exact task identification int could edit better explanation expensive use strings using enum classes use keywords make sense compiler replace ints computer work much easier never use strings identify classes types things use enums edit used wrong syntax let compiler figure int values rather hardcoding thanks u bodand pointing enum class blocktype int grass dirt etc struct block glm vec position blocktype type usage example block grassblock block position blocktype grass optimisation point post also another thing aware working lower level languages still horrible frame times per frame scene rendering spent days stuck issue used performance analyser tell function program spent time executing felt relieved ashamed time ever saw cpu time spent know c probably saw coming title pay attention performance analyser showed function std vector vertex std allocator vertex took cpu time wondered calling function much mesh draw function simply instructs opengl draw vao copy vectors draw function issue loop horror part title copied mesh object including megabytes vertex data every frame explain happened know c values copied default say int int b b store value independently true bigger objects like mesh object said auto mesh meshes mesh draw shader compiler understood essentially english code mesh reserve memory space size mesh mb make local copy mesh memory space call draw copy argument shader one small adjustment later auto mesh meshes mesh draw shader compiler understands mesh call draw mesh argument shader intention start use reference character compiler went default option copying value meant cpu spending every frame duplicating megabytes reserving megabytes ram biggest part step completely useless since data local variable loop means gets effectively removed every cycle loop every frame optimisation place frame time per frame capped monitor fps limit improvement factor probably much much fps cap show many improvements make course kind problem even considering since languages already knew used references default ever find working c anything performance matters always check see using references another way bigger optimisation lesson trying optimise manually using performance analyser start spent days working functions problem first place problem even functions methods syntax syntax error mean syntax wrong tempting new programmers think understand code especially bigger programs become easily impossible know program struggling care strings thing computer finds far harder use might expect knowing things computer finds hard especially working custom data types functions google fast slow almost impossible accurately predict yes program wasting dozens milliseconds copying megabytes wasting days using performance analyser used start would understood something wrong loop found issue hour instead tried optimise code measured wasted time way much valuable program frame rate measure program performance issues take lesson free someone learned hard way thank reading wall text hope valuable least entertaining similar learning experience story premature optimisation wasteful copying would love hear,1

show camera classify uploaded image write shakespeare poem play rock paper scissors game etc trained models python using tensorflow keras support consumed demo browser using react javascript version tensorflow models performance first let set expectations repository contains machine learning experiments production ready reusable optimised fine tuned code models rather sandbox playground learning trying different machine learning approaches algorithms data sets models might perform well place overfitting underfitting therefore sometimes might see things like x b patient sometimes model might get smarter give x b background software engineer last several years mostly frontend backend programming spare time hobby decided dig machine learning topics make less like magic like math since python might good choice start experimenting machine learning decided learn basic syntax first result playground cheatsheet learning python project came practice python time cheatsheet basic syntax need things like dict via comprehension x x x etc learning bit python wanted dig basic math behind machine learning passing awesome machine learning course andrew ng coursera homemade machine learning project came time creating cheatsheet basic machine learning math algorithms like linear regression logistic regression k means multilayer perceptron etc next attempt play around basic machine learning math nanoneuron simple javascript functions supposed give feeling machines actually learn finishing yet another awesome deep learning specialization andrew ng coursera decided practice bit multilayer perceptrons convolutional recurrent neural networks cnns rnns time instead implementing everything scratch decided start using machine learning framework ended using tensorflow keras also want focus much math letting framework instead wanted come something practical applicable something could try play right browser result new interactive machine learning experiments came want describe
