## Quick start:

1. New to programming? Not sure how to start learning? See [FAQ - Getting started][faq-start].
2. Have a question? Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.
3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:

## Getting debugging help

If your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:

1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].
2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.
4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.
5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.

Do your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.

Also see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!

## Asking conceptual questions

Asking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.

If you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.

## Subreddit rules

Please read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting. If you see somebody breaking a rule, report it! Reports and PMs to the mod team are the quickest ways to bring issues to our attention.

,learnprogramming,"I'm a web developer and I hate it.

I enjoyed learning how to code and making my own projects. It was fun, but ever since I got a job as an actual web developer (full stack) , I've slowly started to realize I messed up. Here is my list of reasons

1. There is no creativity. Management tells you what needs to be done, what frameworks and languages to use, etc.. you simply follow orders and listen.
2. There is extremely little ""original coding"". By that, I mean all you basically do is glue API's, libraries and services together. You hardly ever code anything from the ground up.
3. A few of my other friends got into artificial intelligence, machine learning, embedded systems, etc. They are working on SUPER COOL stuff. I'm jealous. One of my friends who is an embedded engineer is now programming medical devices that screen for a bunch of stuff (cancer, etc).. like that is world changing stuff.. here I am gluing API's together for businesses?? Another friend is a data engineer who prepares all the data infrastructure to be used by biologists who are doing ground-breaking research on deadly diseases (including covid-19). One more who is working in game development, and creating video game engines in C++ and using a lot of math and physics. Ugh, I just think there are so many interesting areas of CS and web dev is the worst one. 
4. Everyone is going into web development these days, I fear that with all this competition there is going to be a huge saturation, and possibly wage decreases as time goes on

Sorry for my rant, I just want to know if there is anyone who shares similar thoughts as me.

,learnprogramming,"I'm learning to build a simple MERN application to take user data and upload it to a mongoDB collection, and I can't seem to figure out why I'm receiving a 400 BAD REQUEST error when attempting to post the user data. It's currently being run on local server. I'm currently unable to find a post that directly solves my particular issue. I have used post man to send my post requests.

Here is my User.js for the data schema i have placed it in a folder called routes:

    const mongoose = require('mongoose'); const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({     name:{         type:String,         required:true,         min:6 },     email:{         type:String,         required:true,         max:255,         min:6 },     password:{         type:String,         required:true,         max:1024,         min:6 },     date:{         type:Date, default:Date.time     } });  module.exports = mongoose.model(""User"", userSchema);

 i have this auth.js file for routes, i have placed it in a routes folder, i have a .env file to store some credentials to connect to the database. 

  

`const router = require('express').Router(); const User = require('../model/User');   router.post('/register', async(req,res)=&gt;{ const user = new User({         name:req.body.name,         email:req.body.email,         password: req.body.password     }); try{ const savedUser = await user.save();      res.send(savedUser); } catch(err){         res.status(400).send(err);         console.log(err); } });  module.exports= router;`

 This is my index.js file, i think it works alright cause i see server is up and running on port 3000 and connected to database. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

    const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const dotenv = require('dotenv'); const mongoose = require('mongoose'); //import routes const authRoute =  require('./routes/auth');    dotenv.config(); //connect to DB mongoose.connect('process.env.DB_CONNECT',{ useNewUrlParser: true },()=&gt;{     console.log('connected to the database'); }); //Middlewares app.use(express.json()); //route middlewares app.use('/api/user', authRoute);  app.listen(3000, ()=&gt;{     console.log('server is up and running on port 3000'); });

 i have use post man to send post requests but i am met with 400 bad request. There is no error in the terminal. Using the RestEasy app i get the following response.

,learnprogramming,"Mods, if this is inappropriate for the subreddit feel free to take it down, but I wanted to share this as a beginner, since it is a mistake I expect other beginners in C++ like myself to easily make and find hard to track down, especially if they are coming from a higher-level language like Python. And this experience will drill into my head to always check if something is a reference or a copy, as well as to never blindly optimise. So it seems appropriate to /r/learnprogramming for any other people learning to program in C++. Also, this was my first actual project in C++ so please be kind to my very very stupid mistake.

----

As a warning ahead of time, this is a bit of a wall of text, talking about stuff that is a little bit closer to the metal than most beginners are familiar with (at least I was). I try to keep it simple and high-concept level, but the fundamental issue does mean I need to talk about memory management a little bit. I hope I explain the concept simple enough that you can follow along even if you have never worked in a language with manual memory management. I also talk about a thing YOU can do better, rather than your code, that I hope people take to heart as a great practice to speed up development of anything you work on in the future, including languages that work at a much higher level.

----

To set the scene, the young and foolishly optimistic beginner developer tries his hand at crafting a voxel world. Using [an extremely useful free online guide](https://learnopengl.com/) (I swear this isn't an ad, that guide was just super good for me, and I highly recommend it for anyone else interested in openGL with C++) he gets pretty far pretty quickly, and the cube in front of him is rendered beautifully ^(after the 8th try). Satisfied and confident in his skills, he reaches for the skies and renders two cubes at the same time! Still rendering beautifully. 4. 8. 16. 16 x 16. 

At this point, my framerate starts to fall, but the answer is clearly available. All the tutorials say to construct a VBO for multiple objects at once, and render the whole collection in one go, rather than one cube at a time. After some shenanigans, the solution to which was easily tracked down, the 16x16 scene is rendered fast and beautifully. So once again our overconfident developer scales up. 32x32. 64x64. 128x128.

But now the framerate is dropping again. Has he reached his GPU's limit? There are 16 384 cubes in his world, for a total of 589 824 vertices to render. Is that too much? Everyone online says no, a modern GPU can render billions of vertices, so half a million should be trivial.

So it must be a CPU problem, no? The profiler does say the CPU is the bottleneck, but the code ran every frame is relatively simple.

    for (auto mesh : meshes) {  
        mesh.Draw(shader);  
    }

Note that the `meshes` vector only contains a single `mesh` object, which simply manages the only VAO/VBO in the scene, and stores a copy of all the floats (of which there are 4 718 592, amounting to 18 MB raw) that the GPU was sent once during the setup. And no, I was not sending all vertex data every frame, that I saw ahead of time was a bad idea. This is more subtle than that.

Now, those who know C++ well can already understand exactly why I am only getting 15 FPS for what amounts to a very simple scene. But coming from python, I had no idea what was causing the CPU to be this slow. So rather than take a closer look at my CPU profiler data, I took the stupid-headed approach of manually searching through my codebase for optimization problems

----

**Side track for another beginner-type performance mistake in C++**

So I started to track down possible issues. One thing I encountered was that I was storing my block data in a struct like this:  

    struct Block{  
        glm::vec3 position;  
        std::string type;  
    };

    //usage example
    Block grassBlock = Block{ position, ""grass"" };

Pro tip: don't use strings for high-quantity often-copied objects. Replacing this with an enum class for the types of blocks massively sped up my load times. Copying strings is very expensive because it has to allocate much more memory than a simple int, but it performs the exact same task of identification that an int could do^(*edit: better explanation of why it is expensive to use strings.*). By using enum classes, you can use keywords that make sense to you, while the compiler can just replace those with ints that the computer can work much easier with. Never use strings to identify classes or types of things. Use enums.

*Edit: I used the wrong syntax here, and should let the compiler figure out the int values rather than hardcoding them. Thanks to /u/BODAND for pointing this out to me.*

    enum class blockType : int{
        grass,
        dirt,
        /*etc*/
     };

    struct Block{
        glm::vec3 position;
        blockType type;
    };

    //usage example
    Block grassBlock = Block{ position, blockType::grass };

 This optimisation isn't the point of this post, but it is also another thing you should be aware of when working with lower level languages.

----

But I was still having horrible frame times (~0.05 s per frame) during the scene rendering itself. After I spent days stuck on this issue, I used a performance analyser to tell me what function my program spent the most time executing. And I felt the most relieved and ashamed at the same time I ever had when I saw where 78.98% of my CPU time was spent.

If you know C++, you probably saw this coming from the title. If you don't, pay attention. The performance analyser showed that the function `std::vector&lt;Vertex, std::allocator&lt;Vertex&gt;&gt;` took up 78.98% of my CPU time. But how, I wondered? Where am I calling this function that much? My `Mesh::Draw` function simply instructs openGL to draw the VAO, it doesn't copy vectors. But it wasn't the draw function that was the issue. It was the for loop itself. Now for the ""horror"" part of the title:

----

#&gt;!It copied the mesh object, including all 18 megabytes of vertex data, every frame.!&lt;

----

To explain what happened to those who don't know, in C++ values are copied by default. If I say

    int a = 1;
    int b = a;

then a and b both store the value 1, independently. The same is true of bigger objects, like my mesh object. So when I said

    for (auto mesh : meshes){
        mesh.Draw(shader);
    }

what my compiler understood was essentially (in english code):

    for each mesh:
        reserve memory space of size of mesh (which is ~18 MB)
        make local copy of mesh to that memory space
        call Draw() on the copy with argument shader


One small adjustment later:

    for (auto &amp;mesh : meshes){
        mesh.Draw(shader);
    }

and my compiler understands:

    for each mesh:
        call Draw() on that mesh with argument shader

which was my intention to start with. But because I didn't use the reference character `&amp;`, my compiler went with the default option of copying the value, which meant my CPU was spending each and every frame duplicating 18 megabytes. Reserving 18 megabytes of RAM was the biggest part of that step. All of it completely useless, since that data is a local variable to the for loop, which means it gets effectively removed again every cycle of the for loop, every frame.

With the optimisation in place, my frame time was down to 0.0083 s per frame, capped to my monitor's 120 FPS limit, an improvement of factor &gt; 6, (and probably much much more, but my FPS cap doesn't show that).

There are many more improvements I can make, of course. But this was the kind of problem I wasn't even considering, since the languages I already knew used references by default. If you ever find yourself working in C++ for anything where performance matters, always check to see if you are using references where you should.

----

But in another way, there is a bigger optimisation lesson here: I was trying to optimise manually. Don't do that. If I was using a performance analyser from the start I wouldn't have spent days working on functions that weren't the problem in the first place. The problem wasn't even any of my functions or methods, it was my syntax. **Just because there is no syntax error doesn't mean your syntax isn't wrong.** It is tempting for new programmers to think they understand their own code. You don't. Especially in bigger programs, it can become easily impossible to know what your program is struggling with, and what it doesn't care about. Strings are such a thing that a computer finds far harder to use than you might expect. But knowing what things a computer finds hard, especially if you are working with custom data types or functions where you can't google if it is fast or slow, is almost impossible to accurately predict.

Yes, my program was wasting dozens of milliseconds copying megabytes. But I was wasting days not using a performance analyser. Had I used it from the start, I would have understood that there was something very wrong with my for loop, and found the issue in an hour at most. Instead, I tried to optimise code I hadn't measured and wasted my own time, which in a way is much more valuable than my program's frame rate. Measure your program when you are having performance issues, take this lesson for free from someone who has learned it the hard way.

If I was using a performance analyser from the start I wouldn&amp;#39;t have spent days working on functions that weren&amp;#39;t the problem in the first place. The problem wasn&amp;#39;t even any of my functions or methods, it was my syntax. &lt;strong&gt;Just because there is no syntax error doesn&amp;#39;t mean your syntax isn&amp;#39;t wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; It is tempting for new programmers to think they understand their own code. You don&amp;#39;t. Especially in bigger programs, it can become easily impossible to know what your program is struggling with, and what it doesn&amp;#39;t care about. Strings are such a thing that a computer finds far harder to use than you might expect. But knowing what things a computer finds hard, especially if you are working with custom data types or functions where you can&amp;#39;t google if it is fast or slow, is almost impossible to accurately predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my program was wasting dozens of milliseconds copying megabytes. But I was wasting days not using a performance analyser. Had I used it from the start, I would have understood that there was something very wrong with my for loop, and found the issue in an hour at most. Instead, I tried to optimise code I hadn&amp;#39;t measured and wasted my own time, which in a way is much more valuable than my program&amp;#39;s frame rate. Measure your program when you are having performance issues, take this lesson for free from someone who has learned it the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading through this wall of text, I hope it has been valuable or at least entertaining to you. If you have a similar learning experience or story with premature optimisation or wasteful copying, I would love to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on the book Programming Principles using C++, chapter 13 and I have come to a stop.

The current chapter asks to build a class Arc that draws an arc using the FLTK library. I am not well versed in mathematics or seeing how to build shapes through code but I am able to understand these patterns and logic and how to get the results in paper. When it comes to building this class I am baffled in how to write the code that draws the shape.

THIS IF FOR AN ASSIGNMENT. 

I am trying to send an array of random (positive and negative) ints to the method ""isEven""  from main. The goal is to search the array for negative and positive ints.

My ""random int generator"" is working fine and creates 10 random ints, and when I tested passing it to the method is worked fine. However, when I through recursion into the mix, it read an arrayIndexOutofBounds expectation.  I'm pretty stuck and am looking for some advice (aside from never using recursion again).

I think the issue may be how I am passing the array to the method? As when I set the ""is less than 0"" condition it creates an error because the array size cant every be less than 0. But, still, I am unsure about this.

so here's the question...

in java there are maximum and minimum values for the primitive type int you can actually figure it out using this wrapper class\_\_  Integer.MIN\_VALUE\_\_\_\_  Integer.MAX\_VALUE  
the maximum number is 2147483647  
now when you try to declare a variable of type int and let's say give it the (max value+1)(manually) of the type int which is 2147483648 an error occurs...  
here's the code to be specific :   int max1 = 2147483648;

however if you use an operator to store that max value+1 the code works fine even though it overflows there is no error at all and here's what i mean :

int max1 = 2147483647+1;  
now i'm not asking why it overflowed or something like that my question only goes around the error that occurred in the first place and didn't in the second.

now when you try to declare a variable of type int and let&amp;#39;s say give it the (max value+1)(manually) of the type int which is 2147483648 an error occurs...&lt;br/&gt;
here&amp;#39;s the code to be specific :   int max1 = 2147483648;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however if you use an operator to store that max value+1 the code works fine even though it overflows there is no error at all and here&amp;#39;s what i mean :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;int max1 = 2147483647+1;&lt;br/&gt;
now i&amp;#39;m not asking why it overflowed or something like that my question only goes around the error that occurred in the first place and didn&amp;#39;t in the second.&lt;br/&gt;
thanks for your help.&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Problem:

I am looking to create a  function that takes a list of integers as one parameter and one integer as a second parameter. The function returns True if the difference between every adjacent pair of integers in the list produces a value equal to the second parameter (the integer). If there is any pair of adjacent integers in the list whose difference does not produce the second parameters as the result when they are subtracted (ignoring the sign), the function should return False.

This is what I have so far (using an example of 'valueDiff(\[3, 6, 9, 6, 9\], 3)'):

    def valueDiff(int_lst, integer):
    
    nums = len(int_lst)

            return True
        else:
            return False

When I enter this into the shell it returns False which is not correct. I know that where my error lies is in line 3, I am not understanding how to take the value in position \[0\] of the list and subtract it from the value in position \[1\] of the list, and so on.

I want to learn how to program, but there are so many different languages out there.

I'm trying to put together a series of courses/materials to learn programming, and am seeking advice/input on whether my choices are sufficient enough - or too tough - for a beginner.

I want to learn programming with foundations and theory in place as opposed to a compressed bootcamp-esque approach.

My main goal is to develop tools for my workplace, specifically to help with streamlining processes with our day to day workflows, with the eventual hopes of carving out a technology-based position for myself, managing our enterprise infrastructure, and leveraging that experience into a full time programming/coding position elsewhere.

From what I've read, CS50 seemed to be a frequently mentioned choice as a  good starting point. I would like to supplement this with some foundational courses from Berkeley's CS Program, namely CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ([https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)), and the 'How to Design Programs' text ([https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/index.html](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/index.html))

Finally, I'd like to learn Python as my starting language, and was wondering if attempting the O'Reilly 'Learning Python' text was a good idea for beginners such as my self.

,learnprogramming," I'm trying to write a script that can resample some data of mine by using the ArcPy library to call the function in ArcMap. My script tells me that the resample was successful but when I open up the output files they have no data values in them. When I do this process manually in ArcMap with the same files as a test using the same exact parameters they come out just as expected. Any help?

Can someone tell me why this error is coming?

I think may be its coming because i havnt put 

`HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE : anonymous` 

I tried it but error is still there

Also i have one question - when we put variables in heroku

Do i have to wrap value in ' ' . Like this is correct

,learnprogramming,"So from reading I understand that goto can easily create a mess in the code and should be avoided, but sometimes I can't help thinking it's the cleanest and least verbose option.   
Take this simple example where the game asks the user if he/she wants to play a new round. If the user doesn't press either ""y"" or ""n"" it asks again.   


How could it be written in a better and cleaner way than with a goto like this?   


        ContinueGamePrompt:
        Console.WriteLine(""Do you want to play a new round? y/n"");
        switch (Console.Readline().ToLower())
        {

I guess I could also do it with a do while loop like this but, from what I can see, that's just an extra level of nesting and conditions for no real benefit.

        do

,learnprogramming,"So just to preface this question: I am learning C right now and am proficient in Python, Java and Golang so I am not at all new to coding.

I have been using LeetCode to help me learn C and one thing I have seen is that my functions seem to be failing if I fail to mention one of the input parameters. Is it true that all parameters must be used in the function?

Here's an example of a function I am writing that is my answer to the LeetCode problem [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/):

    int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize){
        int* result = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
        *returnSize = 2; //line in question
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numsSize-1; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j &lt; numsSize; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                        result[0] = i;
                        result[1] = j;
                        break;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

As you can see, there is a parameter `int* returnSize` that is given but I didn't really have any need for it. If I submit the code in the code block above, everything works fine. If I then were to comment out the third line in the code block that contains `//line in question`, then it will give me the following error:

,learnprogramming,"\[SOLVED\] - ""output"" did not end with `'\0'` so the output loop kept running. Thanks!

I'm writing a program in C for a course I'm taking, but there's one issue I can't wrap my head around.

I have a program in which the user provides a key (26 alphabetical characters, case-insensitive) and a string of input. The program then encrypts the input and returns the encrypted string. I have all of this done, but when my input length is 1, such as when the user enters ""a"" and the key is ""QWERTY...,"" the program returns something like ""qY+y""

I've fought with this for several hours now, and I can't see what's causing it.

The basic run-down of how I set this up:

    // get the key, test whether or not it is valid (alphabetical, length of 26)
    // store the key in char used_chars[26]
    // loop through the input and check that there're no duplicate letters
    // store the valid key as ""key""
    
    // get input from user and store it in a ""before"" variable
    
    // loop through the input and convert letters - only code I'll include here
    
    for (int i = 0, j = strlen(input); i &lt; j; i++)
    {
        int value = input[i];
    
        if (value &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 'z')
            value = key[input[i] - 97]; // setting a=0 ... z=26
    
        else if (value &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 'Z')
            value = key[input[i] - 65] - 32 // setting a=0, then a=A
    
        output[i] = value;
    }

Here's an example of output:

    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: This is a test
    after: Ziol ol q ztlz // CORRECT
    
    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: a
    after: qS^ // INCORRECT
    
    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: a
    after: qCkQ // CHANGES EVERY TIME

I can provide more details if needed, but I'm kind of at the end of my wits about this. Not to mention, it works just fine when I step through it in the debugger.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const hash = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10)const user = await userRequest.findUser(req.body.email);if(!user){console.log(&amp;quot;user not found&amp;quot;)}else {console.log(&amp;quot;user found&amp;quot;)// return user also exist}}catch (err) {console.log(&amp;quot;error has come&amp;quot;)res.send(400).status(&amp;quot;error&amp;quot;, err)}})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clicnt.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const { GraphQLClient } = require(&amp;#39;graphql-request&amp;#39;);const client =() =&amp;gt;{return new GraphQLClient(&amp;#39;https://edu-2020.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql&amp;#39;, {headers: {&amp;quot;x-hasura-admin-secret&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Salhotra1&amp;quot;// &amp;quot;authorization&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Bearer &amp;quot; + jwtToken},})}module.exports = {client}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i can see in console &amp;quot;entered find user&amp;quot; with correct email id.  But after that it leaves this code of block entirely and goes out and display&lt;code&gt;console.log(&amp;quot;error has come&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, what I want is to make the rectangle fit around a specific building that the user clicks on. Should I just look up the coordinates for each building and do it manually? I did it for one building manually and it works. How do I make sure the rectangle fits around each building I click on?

,learnprogramming,"Hello fellow redditers, both programming  learners and teachers.

So I've been taking a free online course on both \*\*HTML\*\* and \*\*CSS\*\* so I could experiment with front-end development and understand if it is of my liking or not and I ended up learning a lot of things with it.

In this specific project I had to choose 1 out of 1 website main pages, in between which were websites like youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. I ended up choosing GitHub. The challenge here was to create a replica as loyal as possible to the professionally made website's main page.

During this course I learned a lot about different \*\*HTML tags\*\* that can be uses to build any website desired such as:

* HTML and Body Tag (&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;)
* Head tag and its elements: title, meta, and link tags: ( &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;meta&gt; &lt;link&gt; )
* Different div tags, and other specific elements like paragraphs, unordered lists, ordered lists, audio, video, hyperlinks, forms and form elements and span text elements.
* CSS styling rules ans specificity
* CSS media rules and mobile responsiveness
* Working with flex-box to display various elements.

I will leave the link for my Github repository with the code in the following post so you can check my code and understand a bit better how it works.

Here is the list of questions and their answers in a few words. I'll link my article after for better formatting and way more details, but this way you can decide if it's worth reading for you:

1. **What programming language should I learn?** For a very general answer, go for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can make websites, mobile applications, software and games with them.
2. **What is the best way to learn programming?** Follow a good tutorial, then stop using tutorials entirely and do personal projects.
3. **Do I need to be good at maths to be good at programming?** No, except in some very special cases.
4. **Do I need a degree to learn programming?** No, but you have to be self-critical and keep in mind that you don't know what you don't know.
5. **Do I need a degree to get a software developer job?** It will be hard without one. You will lack some skills, but also you will compete with people that have a better profile for the same job offer.
6. **Sometimes I get stuck on a basic problem for hours, is it normal?** Yes, totally, I get stuck for hours on stupid issues all the time. Just make sure that you leverage those struggles to learn from them.
7. **Is programming hard to learn?** Yes, but it gets better, quickly.
8. **What tools should I use?** It doesn't matter.
9. **I use Google a lot and I feel like I’m cheating, is it bad?** No, quite the contrary. I use it a lot on the job, and you have to learn to use it early.

Oh wait I also did Matlab. Now. As you can see that's a lot of different languages so I feel kinda lost. I have a lot of free time now and want to self study and maybe do an online course. I'm not sure what path to go down or what language to study but thank God I don't have to do all those different languages again because that was a nightmare and I feel like no University should teach like that.

,learnprogramming,"Hello,

I've been trying to establish a connection from Android Studio to a MySQL database with Cloud SQL. Basically I setup the MySQL database to be hosted on Google Cloud SQL and then I used JDBC to connect Android Studio with it.

Using the exact same connection parameter, I was able to connect it using a regular IDE (IntelliJ IDEA). I was able to run multiple queries, getting and inserting data and it was updating perfectly.

However, trying to do the same in Android Studio is messing with my head. I'm getting this error:

&gt;`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure.`

&gt;`The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.`

So far here's what I've concluded/done:

* It's probably not a whitelisting issue

 * I checked what IP the emulator is using and it seems like when checking in browser it's using the host machine's address

* Emulator -&gt; cloud connection is correct

 * I changed the jdbc connection (using the wrong ip) and it outputted a different error

* It could be the cloud refusing the emulated Android device's connection

 * I disabled the whitelisted IP and then tried using my initial test code in IntelliJ IDEA and it gave me the same error as if I'm connecting using Android Studio with the whitelisted IP

* I've tried copying the JDBC string directly  from MySQLWorkbench

 * No difference in error message

* I've deleted and reimported the MySQL connector to Java. Its lack of was an error I encountered when testing in IDEA

Is the following explanation the way the compareFunction inside the sort() method works? 

1. Current: \[""Leonardo"", ""Michelangelo"", ""Raphael"", ""Donatello""\]  
The sort function first compares 'Leonardo' to 'Michelangelo'.  
a.length - b.length now means 8 - 9, which equals -1.  
If compareFunction(a, b) returns &lt; 0, it sorts a to an index lower than b.
2. Current: \[""Leonardo"", ""Michelangelo"", ""Raphael"", ""Donatello""\]  
Now the function compares 'Michelangelo' to 'Raphael'.  
a.length - b.length now means 12 - 7, which equals 5.  
If compareFunction(a, b) returns &gt; 0, it sorts b to an index lower than a.
3. Current: \[""Leonardo"", ""Raphael"", ""Michelangelo"", ""Donatello""\]  
Now the function compares 'Michelangelo' to 'Donatello'.  
a.length - b.length now means 12 - 9, which equals 3.  
If compareFunction(a, b) returns &gt; 0, it sorts b to an index lower than a.
4. Current: \[""Leonardo"", ""Raphael"", ""Donatello"", ""Michelangelo""\]

So what am I doing wrong? Can you please help me?&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Coming in to Flatiron School, I was incredibly excited. I had committed myself to following my dream of becoming a UX Researcher and Designer (which was a big mental undertaking for me, truly going for what I knew I’d be good at, versus development where I “manage”). I couldn’t afford the tuition, and my credit wasn’t good enough for a loan or ISA program, so when I got a call on February 4th that I had been awarded a scholarship thanks to NexTech’s “100 Innovators in Tech” program, I couldn’t help but cry. I was a month from being homeless, my job search was going poorly (and I needed a new career direction). This was the Hail Mary that I thought was going to turn my life around.

With this scholarship, my family agreed to help me obtain an apartment in Denver and cover my rent during the program. This investment would end up being over $10,000.

Sadly, my health failed just as the cohort I was set to join got kicked off in early March. I alerted my instructors, and after several weeks it became apparent that I needed to defer to a later class. I did so. 

I had serious issues with the program during my first initial stint. Featuring disjointed materials, only 15 mins of weekly “face to face” time with your instructor when you’re expected to put in 30+ hours each week, educational coaches that don’t understand the material or the industry, weekly lectures that served as merely a recap and then an hour of clearing up all the confusion around the homework (they call this “learning through iteration”, but in the end it’s just stress for no reason and hours of wasted work). Regardless, I was eager to give the program another shot. 

Then Flatiron pulled the rug out, here is how things play out….

**April 1st**

I get an email at 9 A.M about my transfer, stating “If you do not reply by 9AM 04/02/2020, your case will be closed and you will be dismissed from the program.”  and “We will look for availability in the Full-Time Online UX/UI 04/04/20 If the cohort is full, we will look for space in the next available cohort 05/25/20.” 

I respond and let the team know that the 04/04/20 Cohort is good with me, and get an auto-response saying it may take them 48 hours to respond, but I could be dismissed for not responding by the next morning?! 

**April 2nd**

I get an email stating “Apologies for the confusion, the next available cohort is not 04/04/20. It is actually 05/04/20. Please let me know if you are still interested in transferring.” I respond that I will make this work.

**April 3rd**

I get an email stating “We have completed the transfer from the Denver Design UX/UI  05/25/2020 cohort. Unfortunetly, the 05/04/2020 cohort is no longer available since it hsa been merged with the 05/25/2020 cohort. You will join this cohort at the beginning of Phase 1 which stars on 05/25/2020.”

If you’re counting, this is third date I’m given in three days.

**April 15th**

I check in and student services tells me that I’m still enrolled. However, my question on who my instructors would be is dodged again.

**April 21st**

A post goes up on the Flatiron Blog [here](https://flatironschool.com/blog/covid-corporate-response), cancelling the UX/UI program. Apparently, this (and other options) had been under consideration for several weeks.

**April 22nd**

At 9 PM, an email is sent to students. We can transfer to another program, but mine also includes the line “I understand you were awarded the Cognizant NexTech 100 Scholarship and if you plan to proceed with transferring to a new program, we can assist you with being reviewed by our scholarship committee again and previous eligibility used to evaluate your scholarship award.”

I’m sorry? I was already awarded this scholarship, we invested thousands of dollars so I could have this opportunity, and you’re going to make me go through the approval process again? Leases were signed, plans established, this isn’t some side show in my life. Also, not even a phone call?

**April 23rd**

I’m destroyed. There’s a job guarantee attached to this program, I don’t have the funds to go to another bootcamp and at this point things are already looking bad economy wise. I scurry to get enrolled in the Software Program because I don’t know what else to do, and supposedly they pull all these strings to make this happen. It turns out that the Admissions team was informed THE DAY BEFORE that this was happening, and had no chance to form a response. By the way, that program they enrolled me in? It starts May 11th with an estimated 160 Hours of “pre-work”. 

So now not only is my life turned upside down, I have a little over 2 weeks to complete 4 weeks worth of pre-work that I was in no way prepared to start.

**April 24th-April 28th**

After taking the day, I realize how screwed up this is on Flatiron’s part. From how they’ve treated their own staff, to how they think we can just switch programs (I specifically wanted to move away from Development), to the handling of the scholarships. All of it is ridiculous.

On April 28th I manage to get on the phone with Cognizant, thinking surely since they had awarded these funds they would allow me to pursue a design program elsewhere. Flatiron couldn’t meet their obligations, why should we suffer as students? 

The result? Flatiron and Cognizant have a “special arrangement” for these scholarship funds, and my only option is to transfer courses. They refuse to release my scholarship funds so I can attend General Assembly or another program of my choice. 

**Consider other options, even for non UX programs**

At the end of the day, Flatiron certainly churns out students that get jobs. But the real ask here is, are you comfortable giving your money and time to a company that will behave in this manner? That will treat staff and students alike with such little regard? That would take someone who is already in one of the most vulnerable positions of their life, see that their actions are causing immense pain and financial disruption, and walk away without a second thought?

**They still don't have it together**

Even after going rounds with the admin staff and letting them know I'm not backing down from my claims, they still haven't even taken the time to update their system to reflect that I'm no longer a student. As of today May 8th, I'm still receiving emails about joining the slack channel for the Software Engineering Cohort starting next week.

,learnprogramming,"I wanted to start with a ""hello world"" for both the languages, just to get a feel for it. First step obviously, was to install the language and whatever it takes to get programs to run. I am doing this on Windows. What I noticed with Rust is that it required the MSVC build tools, while Go does not. Both produce native binaries.

,learnprogramming,"Hi all,

Hope you all are doing well during this time.

So, just some background about my self: I am an undergraduate final semester Business Administration student with no CS/Programming/Coding knowledge. I am not at all a computer science person, in fact get that panic feel whenever I see someone programming lol. Jokes apart, I aim to get into project management career down the road and figured that a good project manager needs to understand the basics of programming to be able to make sense of what the development teams are doing. So, I decided to use this free time to develop CS/Programming knowledge and skills.

But one of my biggest weaknesses is mathematics!!!!! I can't describe enough hahahha. I failed basic calculus university course two times before barely passing it on the 3rd time.. So, you know how bad I am. Its not that I am bad at basic stuff like general algebra. I find myself pretty good at the basic math, but when it comes to the other stuff like trigno/calculus/linear algebra etc etc is where I start having panics lol. Its just not my piece of cake. With this weakness, I am not really sure if learning the CS/Programming stuff is realistic or not because my friends say that one needs to be decent at maths to understand programming. Any recommendations on where to get started learning? I read that the CS 50 course is a great course for someone like me who wants to get started. Is this true? Any other relevant info is welcomed!

The problem is that I don't really have the creative mindset that lends itself well to the design elements of making games. Anytime a lesson starts delving into these elements, my brain begins to lose all focus. So my question is this: is there a good way (like an online course perhaps) that focuses almost completely on the programming/coding aspects of game design without going in depth with the visual design elements?

So I ended up with Atom everything was going fine as I was just messing with Conky and trying to customize it on my desire . I wanted to try something different and I went to add a C &amp; C++ compiler and I had no luck. The one with the most downloads and shown on internet was update 4 years ago

,learnprogramming,"Recently I wanted to start digging into the code of a game called RimWorld. I decompiled the source code and started looking through it, only to realize that basically all object defintions seem to be done through XML. I don't believe I've seen a single `Thing t = new Thing();`, but instead all the data for objects like hitpoints, name, description, label, etc. are stored within XML tags, and the decompiled source code somehow connects this data in a way to just execute the logic.

After looking around a bit more it seems that people have said the game uses reflection to define these objects at runtime. I work as a junior C# dev (ASP.NET) but I am fairly certain I have never used reflection in any way before so I'm pretty curious about how this works. Upon looking up some of the base level articles about reflection particularly [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_reflection.htm) and [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/593881/What-is-the-difference-between-2), I still just feel like I'm not quite grasping the concept fully. To me this seems like a completely different concept from the XML definitions I was looking at, I'm not sure how these things relate at all.

I guess this is a very vague topic so I'll try to give some specific questions, but I really just want to learn more about this methodology that RimWorld uses.

* What is the benefit (and drawbacks) of defining your objects via XML and having them defined at runtime? Over just declaring them as objects in C# code as one normally would? To me it seems more modular with cleaner separation, but I can't see any real benefit beyond that.
* How does this data actually get ""connected""? I understand that the XML tags have matching names to the properties of each of these classes, but I feel like I'm missing a step in the middle. How are XML objects mapped to C# objects? Is it just via an XML reader converting the data? I notice all of the classes look pretty normal without any weird XML stuff so I'm guessing there's some place in the code that this is all being handled.
* I guess I'm having trouble grasping how it actually executes in order. It's obvious normally, Object x is declared and defined, which then calls x.Method(), and then that does some logic which returns a value. But when these are dynamically defined at runtime, how is it ensured that everything is defined? For example if you call x.Method(), how do you ensure x is defined, or any of the variables within x are defined to calculate the result of Method? Do they just define all of these in mass at the beginning, and then move into code execution after all of the XML has been handled?

Previously, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dzeza7/i_made_a_learning_guide_to_help_people_become/) a guide to [learn programmming](https://electrichive.github.io/waggle-dance-programming-guide/) that got some traction. For the past few years, using this guide and other materials, we have been building a group that mentors people from all walks of life (including some I met through this subreddit) to become programmers.

This mentoring is and will always be provided free-of-charge, no strings attached. Our only ask is that we request members to make the following pledges:

* I pledge to help make the world a better place.
* I pledge to help mentor budding programmers become socially-conscious hackers.
* I pledge to help create technological solutions for public good.

This is our way of giving back to the programming community and the world, and we're now looking to expand our impact with Reddit's help.

Sounds good? Great! So, how do you get involved? Well, we're looking for more mentees, more mentors, and more members.

* If you want to join our community:
  * Join our [Zulip chat](https://electrichive.zulipchat.com/join/1sd9telza4kr8ckgmfse779b/) (Zulip is an open-source Slack alternative)
  * Join our [Groups.io group](https://groups.io/g/electrichive) (Groups.io is an email listserv-ish website)

,learnprogramming,"Hi there.

I've been trying to learn programming for a while now but with it I've been hammering my head on the wall due to your usual ""newbie"" problem of ""Is this language actually right for me?"" and I've dropped down into it myself while thinking ""Hah! That will never happen to me!"" but I was naive on this one.

I initially began my journey learning Lua with hopes to use Love2D framework to make small games, and so yes that is my plan to learn programming. To create games, but not huge AAA wannabe titles, I just wish to create something small to express my mind but then I stopped due to losing my motivation. When I returned I went back to Go and it was rather amazing thing to learn, the language while very verbose it felt easy to learn but is Go a language that I can accomplish my task? It felt like it with the frameworks available etc Pixel and so on. 

I've tried to explore python due to popular suggestion that every new wannabe programmer should learn it but... I just can't focus while learning it? It doesn't feel the same as learning Golang. It feels bland and boring and I miss the entertainment out of it but I've realised that Golang itself is probably the worst idea to try making small indie games in. 

Would anyone suggest my course of action? Maybe a language that is worth checking out for something that I'm hoping to accomplish? Do you think Golang can actually be used for small game developments?

I'm really sorry for bringing one of those ""I'm new and I don't know what language to learn"" but I really want to get over this wall and carry on learning to actually accomplish something for once.

I didn't find this course great at all, and I lack great concepts as I had seen them doing some exercises. I've already tried to learn Python (and get it, but I go C for university), and then C (which is the college choosen one) for kinda 6 months, but when I saw Java I liked it and there's the key of being versatile and multi-devices (i think?).

Idk if I should even continue in Java, and I accept suggestions if I should go back, or change to another one (which idk if it's healthy too haha). And I really liked HackerRank exercises, but is it possible learn just by coding it?

,learnprogramming,"Hey there, thanks in advance for reading.

I need to create a type of game in Visual Studio using C#. I have labels, buttons and text boxes in the designer (Game.cs)

My class structure is very basic at the moment.

**Grain class:**

    public class Grain {
        public int GrainAmount { get; set; } = 2800;
    }

**Kingdom class:**

    public class Kingdom {
        Grain Grain = new Grain();

        }

I get an error on line 5 of Game.cs, ""Kingdom.Grain is inaccessible due to its protection level.""

As you can see, I need to create a Grain object in the Kingdom class as part of the Kingdom's constructor, but I don't know how to then access the properties of Grain from a class outside Kingdom. The game is supposed to update a label after a button press, to show the value of GrainAmount (which I also need to change by calculating numbers entered into text boxes, but I should be able to do that once I understand why the current code is failing). 

More background info (not that it should be relevant):

I had a working program in Visual Basic, and had to convert to C# and then split the properties in the Kingdom class into their own classes - so previously, Grain was its own property in the Kingdom class and I had no trouble accessing it.

Firstly,   I would like to thank EVERYONE who gave me not only their   encouragement, but kind and constructive criticism. With that in mind, I   completely started back from scratch and decided to follow a lot of  the  recommendation given to me by all of you Reddit and Facebook users!    These features include:

A completely revamped GUI (I literally started the whole thing again from scratch)

The link to the website on the app (cloudifier.carrd.co) now completely works.

Changed iOS Required Version from 13.4 down to 13.0

The Machine Learning Model has a higher accuracy rate.

The results show either a red or green background depending on the percentage value displayed

The red background showed displays an additional note right below it

The background changes to the image selected.

The image displayed in the background is then magnified.

In   order to encourage young and novice developers or simply those who   would like to show off or ask questions about their projects, etc. to   others just like them, I decided to create a new private Facebook Group,   “The NOVICE DEVS” (Note: The group is private, and members are  accepted  via invite from the admin so I can avoid any spam etc.)

&lt;p&gt;-Exercise wise I skate every other day for 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-need to eat more healthy food &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-sleep at 11pm usually wake up at 7:30 or 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-play rts games like COH&lt;/p&gt;

I am prone to impulsive decision making, and it has been a thorn on my side through the last ten years of non-mandatory higher education .  I have wanted to learn how to program for the last three years, but in a general sense i did not know where to start till i bagged  a free membership on an online learning program this march and worked through a computer science course. I enjoyed the first two chapters, and the first section of chapter three. The language being taught was Python. Anyway to cut a long story short, in the 3rd chapter we needed to finally start breaking down problems and program the solutions. It was first how to manipulate lists and carry out operations through them. It took me about a week to solve 8 of those problems and that was with massive online research which was another difficulty since some of the methods they gave me were wrong. Anyway. This pointed out two facts to me, my extreme difficulty when it came to solving problems. And my need to have an available professional who can ""hold my hand"" while working through the problem. That means i need to go back to school if i want to learn software development. I ended up rage qutting after i realized that in the capstone project for all of what i had learned in the first third of the course i was basically imitating the video walkthrough and while i could feel like the solution was making sense. it hit me that i was not thinking like a developer and was just copying. 

Since i do not want to let the membership go to waste, i decided to restart my learning but on the web development path. My hope that is that it wont be as difficult to learn on my own. So i have a question, how difficult would you describe Javascript to be? 

Does web development deal much in the way of data manipulation and operations?  Are the web development technologies/languages difficult to grasp? I wont ask about self learning strategies as most of them rely discipline and motivation. But i do want to get an idea about how difficult it is to learn full stack development? And how it compares to other programming languages/paradigms(to loosely borrow that word)?

It took me about a week to solve 8 of those problems and that was with massive online research which was another difficulty since some of the methods they gave me were wrong. Anyway. This pointed out two facts to me, my extreme difficulty when it came to solving problems. And my need to have an available professional who can &amp;quot;hold my hand&amp;quot; while working through the problem. That means i need to go back to school if i want to learn software development. I ended up rage qutting after i realized that in the capstone project for all of what i had learned in the first third of the course i was basically imitating the video walkthrough and while i could feel like the solution was making sense. it hit me that i was not thinking like a developer and was just copying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since i do not want to let the membership go to waste, i decided to restart my learning but on the web development path. My hope that is that it wont be as difficult to learn on my own. So i have a question, how difficult would you describe Javascript to be? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does web development deal much in the way of data manipulation and operations?  Are the web development technologies/languages difficult to grasp? I wont ask about self learning strategies as most of them rely discipline and motivation. But i do want to get an idea about how difficult it is to learn full stack development? And how it compares to other programming languages/paradigms(to loosely borrow that word)? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

It's similar to NER.

,learnprogramming,"I’m now beginning my first semester as a CompSci student and taking Intro to Programming and a Discrete Data Structures course. The programming course has been amazing and conducive to online learning - video lectures are 15-30 minutes each of pertinent information, the professor is clear/concise/available, and while I’m struggling naturally due to all that’s going on with the pandemic (severe depression/job loss/money issues), I feel like I can take what he’s told me and at least begin to understand. 

I cannot say the same for my data and discrete structures class. Frankly, I’m not even sure why I’m taking it because it’s a pre-req to nothing and I have not seen a lick of code in it. And while I understand topics covered are utilized here and there (fibonacci, proofs, etc) - it’s horribly taught. And I’ve taken similar courses before - the base material is not hard. Convert from binary to 8 bit, solve a proof, dual negation, etc. 

The professor is a nice person, but his uploads are 3+ hour lectures where he breezed through complex mathematics in a very thick accent that’s impossible to decipher. He’s constantly telling us something he put on his slideshow presentation is a typo - and does not correct them before uploading the lecture notes. He also does not opt to have his lectures transcribed. So I can barely get through it.  Obviously the accent isn’t his fault, but he’s very hard to understand. And he doesn’t do what my other professor does and get it transcribed.

Anyway, he teaches in an incredibly dry and disengaging fashion. It has put me to sleep. And I’m a good student. I did well in undergrad, this is a good school, and I usually don’t have issues with motivation and studying, but we’re five weeks in and I’ve tuned out. For three weeks I tried my best. Then, I began to 1.25x the lectures and just read the text. Now, I’m just done with it. The text is a 16 year old book from MIT written by astrophysicists. I shit you not. He just takes bits and pieces from problems and equations and has us read incredibly dry text.

Then there’s the homework. 5 questions a week. I’ll generally just troubleshoot online (not ask the questions outright), but google the topic, teach it to myself and solve it my own way. Everyone else I’ve spoken to now does the same. And I do well on the homework, so I’ve felt okay so far. I’m getting by. At this point, survival through this mess is the name of the game.

Then the midterm. It’s online. I anticipate it’ll be somewhat like the study guide he gave us. I spent a few days once again trying to have this horribly over complicated info stick - it just doesn’t. But I give the study guide the old college try. And then midterm time and, whereas our homework’s were always 5 questions to be done in 2 hours. Now, it’s 32 questions to be done in 2 hours. Sure, there’s 8-10 T/F, but almost everything else requires a good amount of thought and writing the work on scrap paper to then type in all your work on the online exam along with your answer. I didn’t even finish. And very few of the questions were similar to the homework or study guide. They were worded differently (he made these questions himself vs taking straight from the text, causing a big difference in wording with the language barrier), questions were riddled with spelling errors. Total mess. 

So I scramble for 2 hours doing what I know, but trying to use notes online (it’s open note) to just find anything similar to teach myself really quick, to no avail. Ran out of time and catastrophically did bad. To the point I had to use Chegg for a few of my answers (I guess other students did the same, re-worded things, but I feel awful). I’d never do this under normal circumstances, but given how much the grade counts for, how awful this class is structured and dealing with so much anxiety and anguish as I wait on this pandemic to end, I barely get by. Either way, I’ll be stoked to see a C out of it.

I just don’t understand why this person is qualified to teach. He’s a nice guy. And programming isn’t easy - I know that, it’s new to me, but I put the time and effort in. But this discrete data class absolutely made me feel awful. Again, the professor is nice, but how is this class structure good for beginners? I’ve taken similar courses at community college to prepare that were nothing like this. And I still do well on homework’s, but I’m so downtrodden over this exam. I felt misled. I have put the effort in. And I know it’s on me to put effort in, which I do. But this professor is so trying. The lectures are horrible and dry, the text material is so complex for a simpler topic that I need to re learn on Khan academy, the midterm was nothing at all like the study guide or prior homework’s with the verbiage.

,learnprogramming,"So, i have problems understanding the  behaviour of the splice function inside this nested for loop, i was  also learning about the nested for loop behaviour and once i got it, i  bumped into a problem with the splice function.

The main point of this code is to check for matches in the array ( `var count`)and then check if they are a pair dividing them by 2 (`var ol`). If the number isn't pair, i subtract 1 (`if(ol % 1 !== 0 )`)to get the pair amount:

`var ar = [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20];`

`var count = 0;`

`for(var i = 0; i &lt; ar.length; i++){`

`for(var x =0; x &lt; ar.length; x++){`

`if(ar[i] == ar[x]){`

`count++`

`ar.splice(x, 1);`

`}`

`}`

`}`

`var ol = count/2`

`if(ol % 1 !== 0 ){`

`ol = count - 1`

`}`

`//checks remainder if its !== 0 then its float()`

`console.log(ol);`

I  was able to understand the patterns of the for loops by using a  notebook because i was getting confused with just the console.log

this is the console.log of the array when i called it after  `ar.splice(x, 1);`with `console.log(ar);`

`[ 20, 10, 30, 50 ]`

`[ 20, 10, 50 ]`

Here the link where i wrote in my notebook and how as u increase the splice value changes. I cannot post the screenshot but basically i do not understand this behaviour in the console.log above with the `ar.splice(x, 1)`

whenever i increased the splice value to e.g: `ar.splice(x, 2)`it removed the `[1]`. When using `ar.splice(x, 1)`, somehow the end result was the amount of pair numbers inside the array . Without it it gives me the number 27.

,learnprogramming,"Currently in a graduate level CS class focusing on full stack development. For one of the requirements I wrote client side JavaScript to display the current time for which a given event occurred instead of building the functionality into a flask application. My professor reached out to me after I had already submitted the work and told me a had a day to fix it. I have almost a 100% in this class so I contemplated ignoring it because the semester is over and two weeks and this was a minor part of the app. However, he said something to me that I will remember forever:

“An application can be build a million different ways, but there is a right way and YOU know how. Never take shortcuts and build your applications to be extendable so they can last. For example, what if you needed to surface that element in 10 different places? You would have to refactor your existing code to do this when the next requirement is identified.

For one of the requirements I wrote client side JavaScript to display the current time for which a given event occurred instead of building the functionality into a flask application. My professor reached out to me after I had already submitted the work and told me a had a day to fix it. I have almost a 100% in this class so I contemplated ignoring it because the semester is over and two weeks and this was a minor part of the app. However, he said something to me that I will remember forever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An application can be build a million different ways, but there is a right way and YOU know how. Never take shortcuts and build your applications to be extendable so they can last. For example, what if you needed to surface that element in 10 different places? You would have to refactor your existing code to do this when the next requirement is identified.

Hi, so I've completed the first phase of writing my tutorial series dedicated to all you beginners out there wishing to learn more about data structures and algorithms. These 18 tutorials are designed to be read one at a time and deliver all the necessary knowledge to the reader, without being too overwhelming.

My goal with this one was to provide enough information on the core algorithms and specifically concepts and techniques, as well as some mathematics concepts one may run into when doing competitive programming or just doing a coding interview.

This is a way I wished I was thought when I began, so I get that some people won't find it useful, but that's the order I think is the most suitable for beginners. This is not all algorithmic knowledge one may need, but is just about enough to get you prepared for most easy and some medium problems at places like LeetCode. I really hope you enjoy it and am open to suggestions!

,learnprogramming,"Hi, I’m 20 year old male in Europe. In 2018 I started studying at a university. The bachelor wasn’t really my piece of cake. I took time off to work and travel, and now I need to make a decision what to do next year. 

I’ve been teaching myself through TOP for the past 2 weeks or so, and just about to finish my Google Homepage. I find it very enjoyable so far, and I’m looking forward to learn and create more. 

I have two choices as of now. 1. I go to university next year to study applied mathematics, learn programming next to it as a side. And then afterwards decide if I want to do something with programming as well. 2. I learn to program in the upcoming months and find a job in the field as soon as possible, to learn even more. 

Now, I know exactly what my parents want me to do, go to school, but I think there’s more opportunity in starting a career soon, in terms of what I want to do in the future (other reasons). And I’m definitely choosing for myself what I want to do in life. I also think that as I’m young, I can learn and develop well in the field if I would start now. 

My father tells me I will miss personal development and thinking in a way that is only taught in university. But I’m not completely convinced. I’m driven to study useful things, so I would continue to learn other things than code as well for the rest of my life. My question is: am I really going to miss any personal development if I decide to skip uni and dive right into a career? There’s good things about going to school, and studying for tests to train the mind in a way. But I’m somewhat convinced that I can teach myself these things as well. (By reading and studying a lot at home). 

I know this is not really the place for this question, but maybe some fellow programmers can shed some light. And maybe point me in a direction where to get the knowledge from. I’m leaning towards the 2nd option, as it seems to align more with my future goals.

And then afterwards decide if I want to do something with programming as well. 2. I learn to program in the upcoming months and find a job in the field as soon as possible, to learn even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know exactly what my parents want me to do, go to school, but I think there’s more opportunity in starting a career soon, in terms of what I want to do in the future (other reasons). And I’m definitely choosing for myself what I want to do in life. I also think that as I’m young, I can learn and develop well in the field if I would start now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father tells me I will miss personal development and thinking in a way that is only taught in university. But I’m not completely convinced. I’m driven to study useful things, so I would continue to learn other things than code as well for the rest of my life. My question is: am I really going to miss any personal development if I decide to skip uni and dive right into a career? There’s good things about going to school, and studying for tests to train the mind in a way. But I’m somewhat convinced that I can teach myself these things as well. (By reading and studying a lot at home). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is not really the place for this question, but maybe some fellow programmers can shed some light. And maybe point me in a direction where to get the knowledge from. I’m leaning towards the 2nd option, as it seems to align more with my future goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important factor: costs of education don’t play a role here!&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"I have a database with several tables (contracts, offers, price_history...) Each table has a ""DBComponent"" module in my code responsible for fetching the data and returning it as a pandas dataframe object.

I also have an ""analysis"" package that has functions for performing analysis on these specific dataframes. For example, my price_history_analysis package has functions like ```calculate_statistics(df)``` which will produce summary statics for each contract such as stddev, spread, high, low, etc based on the price_history (OHLC) data. My offers_analysis package has functions like ```get_most_recent_offers(df)``` which will return the latest set of offers for each contract. I also want to have higher-level analysis functions which span multiple domains, such as ""how does the movement of my offer in the orderbook correlate with the volume data in the price_history data""? This would combine the output of several lower-level analysis functions from multiple domains to produce an answer. For example, it may take the output of price_history.calculate_statistics() and combine it with the output of offers_analysis.volume_per_day() the come up with some number that is important to me.

I want to make my code easier to use by doing a few things. 

First, I want to access the lower-level functions like ""what is the high price of contract X for the last 7 days?"" by doing something like ```price_history_df.high_price(contractid, periods)```, instead of accessing it through another package as I am doing now. I want to do this with each of the different dataframe types. Is the best way to do this to create a class for each dataframe type, which extends the pandas dataframe, providing the additional functions I desire? For example, the object returned from my DBComponent would no longer be just a regular dataframe, but a price_history_dataframe? And is it best to put all those functions under a specific package such as price_history_df.analysis.FUNCTION_NAME(), so I am not polluting the namespace of pandas' internal functions? My concern here is that pandas has some functions that will return another dataframe (e.g. .copy()) and in doing so, it will return a pandas dataframe object, not a price_history_df object. I don't want to override hundreds of functions to return my specific dataframe type. I am not sure if this will actually be a problem, but I wanted to mention it.

The second thing I want to do is make it easier to view and manipulate individual records. Pandas is great for analyzing and making changes to large sets of data, but making a change to a single record and saving that back to the database is haphazard... there isn't the type of data validation that I think there ought to be. My thought was to use SQLAlchemy (or some other similar tool) to create a model for each record type and have the validation functions in there. 

I also want to be able to access the relational records through the parent object. For example, I want to retrieve a contract object, then access the price_history of it by doing something like my_contract.price_history.high_price(periods=7), or get the total value of outstanding offers by doing my_contract.offers.open_offers_total_value().

My question is - how do I do both of these things without repeating myself? In some cases these operations are best performed on dataframes; in other cases it seems like these are best performed on an object model. I am not sure if it is feasible to go back and forth between the two (convert dataframes into collections of object models and vice-versa); or if its best to identify where to put the analysis code and just keep it in one spot (dataframe vs object model) - in this case I don't get access to everything when I need it; or if its best to just drop rid of the dataframes altogether and only use object models. This is something I'm not super-excited about, as everything I've written already is designed around the dataframes. I'm also not sure if it makes sense to repeat a bunch of the code that can already easily be accomplished in Pandas.

Also, in these examples - my_contract.offers.open_offers_total_value() - I think what I am really talking about is creating a specific type of **collection** with those functions, which I think would require extending SQLAlchemy's collection record and putting the functions in there, in much the same way I am thinking about extending my pandas dataframe objects.

If you were designing this, how would you approach this?  If you were going to have a DBComponent, and specify if you wanted the result as a dataframe or model object, would it retrieve the model as the ""master"" then just convert it into a dataframe? I'm just confused as to what the best way to solve this is architecturally. I'm sure there are lots of other problems that I'm not even thinking about which should be considered in this design.

I am a CS graduate from a reputable college in India, but during my college time I wasn't much into programming and I hated it. I didn't code that much in my 4 years of college and was even on verge of dropping out, but somehow finished it.

During college, I never applied for any internship or sat for campus placements, as I was adamant at that time not to be in this field.

After graduation(May 2019), I didn't find any other passion, so with some advice from my friend, I started back learning programming. I knew python, so spent some time learning to code in python and used to solve problems on Leetcode (Sept-Oct).

Then I started a course on CS50(Web Programming with Python and JS), where I learnt basics of Flask, Django, Git and other tools from that course and also built some static websites from scratch, which were part of the projects.(Nov-Jan 2020 (first week)).

After this, I started applying for jobs( I don't know whether this was enough for a fresher or not). I appeared for around 5 interviews during (Jan to Feb), and was even offered a job verbally from one of them, but later they ghosted me. Rest of them interviews were not that great, kind of average and honestly they were quite demotivating

Then I wanted to improve my static websites, so started learning Angular from course and learned its basics and concepts.(March-April)

Currently during lockdown, I'm rebuilding one of my previous project using Angular and Django REST Framework.


Now I don't know whether I'm underestimating myself or something else, I need some advice that am I heading in correct direction, as since graduation, I've been out of touch from most of my friends and been home learning, wasting time, and all.

,learnprogramming,"Hi all - 

I checked the FAQ but as I am a novice I'm not fluent in all the different languages and what they are best used for. 

My project:

I have a need to create a calendar-type web application. It consists primarily of two modes: Overview and Focused view. 

Focused view would contain several fields, each containing user inputted information, and would essentially be the ""Day"" mode. This could then be printed to a neatly formatted PDF, added to the Overview, shared with other users, etc...

,learnprogramming,"I'm trying to write a basic function to ""scramble"" (rearrange the letters of) a word. My thinking was to:

1. take the word as an argument
2. use a loop to assign the string to an array
3. use another loop to go through the array, randomly picking items from the array and pushing them to another array, and then splicing those items from the original array
4. repeating that loop until all the items have been spliced (and thus the loop stops)
5. logging the new ""randomized"" array to the console

I'm sure there are better ways to accomplish this but to start with, my idea is not working, so I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong:

    function rand(word) {
      const wordArr = [];

       newArr.push(wordArr[pick]);
       wordArr.splice(pick, 1);
     }

,learnprogramming,"I am supposed to complete this task in a functional manner, so no loops of any sort.

I already completed the task for finding the frequency of single characters. My code looks like this:

`char_freq = {}`

`def getcharfreq(char_freq, ch):`

`char_freq[ch] = char_freq.get(ch, 0) + 1`

`return char_freq`

`#Get the frequencies of each character in the text`

`functools.reduce(getcharfreq, text, char_freq)`

&amp;#x200B;

where text is a long string of many characters. char\_freq is a dictionary with the key being the character, and its value being its frequency in the text.

However, I'm not sure how to go about getting the character doubles, or triples, without using iteration first. For example, if my text were ""I am Jimmy"", the double would be:

""I "",

""am"",

"" J',

""im"",

""my""

The triples would be every 3 characters at a time. It would be simple enough to iterate and add every 2 or 3 characters to a list, then pass that into reduce(). But since I can't iterate, I'm at somewhat of a loss as how to do this.

,learnprogramming,"So me and a friend are in the works of developing a web app which runs on an Express.js server. We want to test it out frequently since its based on multiple people connecting and real time updating their UI. Only thing is, since its in early works we don't really want to buy a server space yet. We figured we could easily just directly connect to the locally hosted server between each other.

I wanted to see **1)** if my logic (I'm about to explain ahead) is generally correct, and **2)** what are the **DOs** and **DONTs** when attempting this. 

I understand it should be as simple as plugging the other person's ip address with correct port number in the browser except for the router/firewall preventing that. Reading around, I've gathered most say to forward port 80 (the port usually associated with HTTP) from the router to the local hosted server, then I have to allow the machine's firewall to accept them at the local server port? It seems usually port 8080 is referred as the local server port, which isn't a requirement I can just use what's free correct? Its only a conventional thing to use that port? Last, I believe I have to change some settings in the router to DHCP so the ip address for the server remains static?

That's my understanding so far, so please correct and help me understand better as I'm fairly new to these concepts. The main concerns I have are with port forwarding 80 as its generally restricted by ISPs and would think to be a much used port considering all of the devices connected to my network.

The second attempt was in the first year of highschool, I bought a book about c#, but it was pointless/usless, because here&amp;#39;s the problem: for me is easier to learn if a line of code, command or smth is explained to me in depth... and I was wondering if you could help we with a guide/tutorial/book where I get detailed explication for everything, and then how to take logical. I tried one week a tutorial from youtube of C# and 0/nada. Now with all the free time at home I want to learn C# or C++. I don&amp;#39;t want other programming languages like Python because I wanna to make windows/mac applications with an interface, like how C# on visual studio allow me.&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Hi all, hope this is a valid question to ask!

So, a quick background - I have no programming/IT education at all, but over the last few years I self-taught C# with Unity, then got a job, learned JavaScript as our developer left and we needed someone to take over quick for some simple stuff and I kinda stuck around at that position and learned by myself. Currently, I'm working with/learning Python and MySQL.

That's why I say explain like I'm five :D

Anyways, I only recently got into this and while I'm doing kinda ok with the coding part, there are obvious lacks of knowledge on my side.

This was the situation: So I installed all I needed on my work Mac, including pip and packages I needed for the test project. Then run Visual Studio Code and it couldn't find any of those. Then I re-installed it from the console inside VSC and everything worked. Which solved my problem. However, I have no idea why that worked and it annoys me when I don't have an answer for something. It's a guarantee that it will come back to haunt me later on.

With my very limited knowledge, I kinda assumed that when I installed pip and packages through Mac terminal, I did a system-wide install, right? And then had to do it all over again in the folder of the project I'm working in, right? Is this connected to ""virtual environments"" that I saw mentioned in some of the tutorials?

Could you please give me more info on how this work and if I am right with this assumption? Also, if anyone could tell me would I replicate the process the same way on Linux (on personal laptop I use Xubuntu 18.04) if I were to work on a project here?

I've been making a text based game in C++ and I have a map which is an array of strings printed one  after another:

`std::array&lt;std::string, 10&gt; map;`

`int playerX, playerY;`

`switch(level){`

`case 1:`

`map[0] = ""###################"";`

`map[1] = ""#O # #"";`

`map[2] = ""# ### #"";`

`map[3] = ""# X # #"";`

`map[4] = ""########## # #"";`

`map[5] = ""# X #"";`

`map[6] = ""# # #"";`

`map[7] = ""# #"";`

`map[8] = ""# # "";`

`map[9] = ""###################"";`

`playerX = 1; playerY = 1;`

`break;`

the array is printed using a for loop.

I've also got a set of if cases which check if certain keys have been pressed

`if(GetAsyncKeyState(VK_UP) || GetAsyncKeyState(0x57)){`

`if(map[playerX][playerY + 1] == static_cast&lt;std::string&gt;(""#"")) continue;`

`if(map[playerX][playerY + 1] == static_cast&lt;std::string&gt;(""X"")) {std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hit an enemy!"" &lt;&lt; std::endl; continue;}`

`map[playerX][playerY] = "" "";`

`map[playerX][++playerY] = ""O"";`

`}`

The GetAsyncKeyState() function comes from windows.h which was imported above. I casted the single character to a string because when they were single characters the error said I was comparing a string to an array of 2 chars (presumably the original character with a nullbyte, I'm not too sure though). I've also tried casting the map value to a string as well because when I cast the character to a string the error changed to it saying `error: no match for 'operator==' (operand types are '__gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt;, char&gt;::value_type' {aka 'char'} and 'std::__cxx11::string' {aka 'std::__cxx11::basic_string&lt;char&gt;'})|`. It still says that one of the operands are a character (unless I'm misinterpreting that), which kinda confuses me since I cast it to a string.

I'm quite confused as to what's going wrong here.

 &lt;code&gt;if ( n &amp;lt; 1 ) {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;return [];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;const array = countdown(n - 1);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;array.push(n);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;return array;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log(countdown(5));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps: I know that changing &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt; will do the job but I dont understand the flow here...&lt;/p&gt;

Question:

&gt;Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.  
&gt;  
&gt;Examples input/output:

    XO(""ooxx"") =&gt; true XO(""xooxx"") =&gt; false XO(""ooxXm"") =&gt; true XO(""zpzpzpp"") =&gt; true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true XO(""zzoo"") =&gt; false

My answer thus far:

    function XO(str) {

,learnprogramming,"I need help with technical implementation of a framework for decentralized wealth management and a concept I’ve coined “node farming” where you basically fund critical infrastructure for maintaining layer 1 networks in a decentralized fashion. 

Currently, you delegate your stake to node owner/operators and they take a % of rewards for their services. Unfortunately, this leads to more centralization as many companies have entered markets for staking services as well as exchanges offering it also like Coinbase, binance and kraken. 

The concept of node farming is relatively simple but helps improve governance and fairness within the network while also making it a seamless process for communities to pool together and own more than just a stake in the network, but actually own the hardware and core infrastructure. Instead of everybody delegating to big exchanges, there needs to be a framework that can support decentralized ownership of the nodes. People can pay these larger entities to secure and maintain the nodes, but ultimately allow them to buy ownership also if they so choose. 

Delegating your stake in some systems, means you are also delegating your votes in the consensus for governance. Many people find it easier to just stake with exchanges and don’t get involved with the governance process. Normally because their is no seamless process for this. 

A community of people within crypto can decide they want to pool resources. Let’s say 50 people. They pick 3-5 different layer 1 networks to buy stakes in. Decentralized node ownership would mean they could go to a service provider and pay for services to lease/buy/finance a node. Now they can begin to acquire ownership in the infrastructure as well and in a more secure way. Experts should secure and maintain the nodes, but ownership should be decentralized. Not just ownership in the software network, but hardware also. 

If a person has a wealth management fund in crypto or a community of people pool funds together, then they could utilize these services to create a seamless process. The true nature behind crypto is decentralization and in recent years, the industry has started to favor deCENTRALIZATION. Its not a good long term answer to the issue. 

Once securely implemented, these concepts will improve security of the network while also opening the doors for decentralized wealth management and community building. 

Node farming would basically be people slowly acquiring ownership of the nodes while using their stakes in various networks to secure them. Hardware infrastructure is needed regardless of what network you choose to have stake in. So people should invest more more into this than a bunch of software networks than wont be around in the future. They can still utilize their hardware later. Over time they can own full nodes etc

It opens many other doors too. Pm for help pls. I have a community ready for this right now and talking to bison trails about implementing on their side.

I'm currently 25  which makes me feel like a failure and in the final year of my degree in software engineering and I feel like I have not learned anything to use in the real world. 

I've done c#, c++, java, sql, wpf, php and html,css. We would learn like 2 weeks of one language before they gave us a generic inventory project and then stop there and move onto the next language.  I would say I have a basic understanding of these languages and how they work but I cannot code any of this stuff off the top of my head or solve a problem without looking at online stuff. I need to look at online material, like stack flow, youtube videos, or other stuff. I never copy-paste full source codes, or just edit someone else's I find online, I type everything by myself and read the code out loud to myself to help me understand it. I understand most of the codes I write, why the code works the way it is. Sadly, most projects we are assigned are just inventory systems or management systems. During my 3 years, I've done like maybe 10 or so inventory/management systems which are just added, delete, update, and search style systems. 


My biggest issue is that sometimes I lack any sort of motivation to do my projects or my personal projects.

,learnprogramming,"Hello,  

I'm currently writing a little game in javascript and I'm running multiple times into the same situation where it _feels_ wrong what I'm doing, but I'm not sure if it is and how to change my ways.

The issue is about an object that is composed of several parts. I tend to create those parts when creating the container object and passing a reference of the container to the parts. This feels wrong since now the parent has a reference to the child and vice versa. This is a circular dependency right?

An example:

```
// player.js
export function CreatePlayer({ name, piece, type }) {
    const player = {
        name,
        playingPiece: piece,
        actor: null,
        move() { return this.actor.move(); },
    };
    player.actor = type === 'human' ? CreateHumanActor({ player }) : CreateAiActor({ player });
    return player;
}

// human-actor.js
export function CreateHumanActor({ player }) {
    return {
        move() {
            if (player.piece.something) {
                // do something
            }
        }
    };
}
```

Here I tried to compose the player into parts. A player has a name, a playing piece and some actor thingy that's different whether it is a human or an ai player.

The actor needs a reference to the player for internal logic and the player needs a reference to the actor to forward the `.move()` call.

I know I could work around this by making the actors just a static function and pass the `player` object as a parameter to that function, but there are other cases where it wouldn't be so easy. 
And I'm asking the general question if the code above is inherently flawed.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently writing a little game in javascript and I&amp;#39;m running multiple times into the same situation where it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; wrong what I&amp;#39;m doing, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if it is and how to change my ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is about an object that is composed of several parts. I tend to create those parts when creating the container object and passing a reference of the container to the parts. This feels wrong since now the parent has a reference to the child and vice versa. This is a circular dependency right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```
// player.js
export function CreatePlayer({ name, piece, type }) {
    const player = {
        name,
        playingPiece: piece,
        actor: null,
        move() { return this.actor.move(); },
    };
    player.actor = type === &amp;#39;human&amp;#39; ? CreateHumanActor({ player }) : CreateAiActor({ player });
    return player;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// human-actor.js
export function CreateHumanActor({ player }) {
    return {
        move() {
            if (player.piece.something) {
                // do something
            }
        }
    };
}
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I tried to compose the player into parts. A player has a name, a playing piece and some actor thingy that&amp;#39;s different whether it is a human or an ai player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actor needs a reference to the player for internal logic and the player needs a reference to the actor to forward the &lt;code&gt;.move()&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I could work around this by making the actors just a static function and pass the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; object as a parameter to that function, but there are other cases where it wouldn&amp;#39;t be so easy. 
And I&amp;#39;m asking the general question if the code above is inherently flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;regards!&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"So, I've been trying to install some libraries for a small ML project and I've done most installs using the following command;

    python3 -m pip install lib_name

They were all installed correctly and stored in site-packages (I'm not sure, is there a way to check where each library is installed that I can show you guys to help sort this out?)

But, when I run a Jupyter notebook(installed from anaconda, also I’m unable to use the conda command in terminal) and try to import these libraries, I get;

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

Also, When I run;

    import os
    os.sys.path

I get;

    ['/Users/my-name',
     '/Applications/anaconda3/lib/python37.zip',
     '/Applications/anaconda3/lib/python3.7',
     '/Applications/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',

     '/Applications/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/IPython/extensions',
     '/Users/my-name/.ipython']

I've tried almost everything on GeeksforGeeks and in the documentation but I'm really just lost and about to give up at this point.

I'm mostly done with the project idea and code but I can't figure out how to import these libraries and actually run that program.

I've asked a severely downvoted [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61584866/problem-with-importing-opencv-on-jupiter-notebook-even-though-it-is-installed-on) on stack overflow but still could not solve this issue.

The basic idea of my project is on my [GitHub here.](https://github.com/Ankush3103/sleepy-driver-alert) Is there an alternate way to try this program without running the libraries on my system? I don't know how useful an online editor would be since I have to use multiple data and code files.

I'm a complete beginner when it comes to using the terminal. Some have also hinted that this issue could be due to installing libraries in a different environment/address but I can't figure out how to fix that either.

I finally finished my first mini project, nothing too fancy. Probably learned way more than going from Tutorial to Tutorial.

The next step I would like to take is to see if all this code full of repeated methods (obviously I was concentrating on making the program work at first, which I was able to achieve) could be reworked on a more elegant way?

,learnprogramming,"I absolutely love coding. Ever since I started this big bootcamp a couple of months back I've felt this total ease and wonderment at how amazing writing a couple lines of code can make a dead page become alive. There have been a couple of key languages and frameworks I've learned since beginning and it really seems like day by day, I seem to enjoy and almost look forward to the next thing to learn. 

But and there is always a but, but....I have this abject fear of failure, of not knowing something and the paralysis that comes over me when I can't seem to find a solution to a problem. The thing is, this is a feeling that has become almost a daily routine the more I've progressed.

 I have this hunger to learn as much as I can about CS to solely dispel this feeling of paralysis. It's a total loss of control and I absolutely hate it, and the more I've progressed,  the harder the concepts have become, the more frequent this parallels has consumed me, the more urgently I seek to dispel it.

Ever since I started this big bootcamp a couple of months back I&amp;#39;ve felt this total ease and wonderment at how amazing writing a couple lines of code can make a dead page become alive. There have been a couple of key languages and frameworks I&amp;#39;ve learned since beginning and it really seems like day by day, I seem to enjoy and almost look forward to the next thing to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But and there is always a but, but....I have this abject fear of failure, of not knowing something and the paralysis that comes over me when I can&amp;#39;t seem to find a solution to a problem. The thing is, this is a feeling that has become almost a daily routine the more I&amp;#39;ve progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this hunger to learn as much as I can about CS to solely dispel this feeling of paralysis. It&amp;#39;s a total loss of control and I absolutely hate it, and the more I&amp;#39;ve progressed,  the harder the concepts have become, the more frequent this parallels has consumed me, the more urgently I seek to dispel it. &lt;/p&gt;

B. if a file object is passed in, does that object need to be returned from each method? I’m not familiar with Python, I just recall some goofiness over how the interpreter handles objects to avoid making people understand/work with pointers and references explicitly - if the file object isn’t returned, will the file object point to wherever it was in the steam before it was passed into a method, or will it point to wherever it was in the output stream at the end of the method? What happens if it is returned?

,learnprogramming,"**Goal:** Android/iOS app that displays tricky-to-spell words when user puts in a letter.

Using Windows 10 Home, VS Studio 2019 Community

&amp;#x200B;

The code runs correctly, except for non-English characters. The program allows some non-English curse words through when the user puts in their first name.

**Expected result:** Program will reject all curse words (within nameCurseWordsList.txt)

**Actual result:** Some non-English curse words are let through or unrecognized.

* Irish, RáIcleach
   * The value in VS Studio debugger is R Icleach. The debugger says the missing letter is a non-breaking space, ASCII code 160.
* German, ScheißKopf
   * The value in VS Studio debugger is ScheiáKopf. The debugger says the ASCII value is 225 á instead of 225 ß. The ASCII code table says the a with acute accent, á, should be ASCII 160.
* Portuguese, Cabrão
   * The debugger shows cabrao.
* Chinese, 王八蛋
   * Characters are unrecognized. The value in the debugger is ?. Also, in the cmd window these characters show as an empty box.
* Japanese, くそ
   * Characters are unrecognized. The value in the debugger is ?. Also, in the cmd window these characters show as an empty box.
* Korean 아, 씨발
   * Characters are unrecognized. The value in the debugger is ?. Also, in the cmd window these characters show as an empty box.

**Error messages:** None

**Tried:**

1. Changing vector input and the related variable, userFirstName, to wstring.
2. Checked to see if VS2019 settings were set to ""Autodetect UTF-8 encoding without signature"" - Already enabled.
3. Changed encoding of nameCurseWordsList.txt from ""UTF-8 with BOM"" to ""UTF-8"".
4. Set VS2019's cmd output window to use the font Lucida Console.
5. [How to handle unicode character sequences in C/C++?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3623698/how-to-handle-unicode-character-sequences-in-c-c)
6. [How can my program switch from ASCII to Unicode?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3613149/how-can-my-program-switch-from-ascii-to-unicode#3614105)
7. [How to show Unicode characters in Visual Studio?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43633256/how-to-show-unicode-characters-in-visual-studio)
8. Used MultiByteToWideChar (after changing wide strings to regular strings)
9. Used WideCharToMultiByte
10. Putting in the wrong word that showed in VS debugger, so it wouldn't reject. Didn't work.
11. Changing my computer's system locale to the beta UTF-8 setting.

,learnprogramming,"Hello guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you will for sure relate to my situation, this post is going to be long so I hope you'll take time to read it and tell me your insights about it. 

What I mostly need are people who have experience, no matter in which field or area, as long as you have any kind of experience, achieved anything or moved forward doing anything. You are the welcome to tell me your thoughts about this.

I am completely open for criticism, do not try to choose your words by fear of offending me, I do seriously have no care for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 19 years old College dropout, (I dropped out at 17 and I just turned 19 in march). I have dropped out not because I was bad at school, I've always been on the top 1% of it without really trying. I had heard a lot about building businesses online since 15 and I had a friend who was already in the 6figures doing Ecommerce. etc so I just dropped out after 1week of college because I couldn't get myself to spend another hour in a classroom where absolutely nothing happens, It was just uninteresting to me, my brain was literally being fried everytime I took a look to my watch and saw that I still had to sit there for another Hour or so.

&amp;#x200B;

Once dropped out, I basically had 2choices (in my head), to either go for Ecommerce and seek help of my friend to get me started, or go all in on Programming until I later figure out what to do with it.

(Since i was always interested in technology, programming, cyber security and all of that).

&amp;#x200B;

1.5 years down the road, I've spent 80% of my time just slacking off, depressing, not being motivated to do anything, exactly the same way at school, where I was spending all my time at home playing video games since age 9, but parents where there to push me into performing at school, so I just managed to do so without having to study at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a few tens of thousands of dollars, but the idea that I'm not giving things my best seriously messes with my head. I've learnt a lot about sales and marketing, and to be honest, I always knew that whatever it is that i'm doing, I can easily become at the top of it, I just know how to improve at things fast, I know how to search, and how to think effectively and rationally, but this one problem of learning how to work my ass off is something that I've never been able to solve.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I am re-questionning my whole decision of being involved in Ecommerce and Advertising in the first place, Thought I have immensely big opportunities coming up my way in the current months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking about restarting from scratch and learning about technology, programming, and just try to do something with it, I've learnt to be a problem solver, and gone deep into selling, so that may be a good asset for the rest of my career, but i'm certainly not an employee, and I'll never be one (that should be considered for what's next). So whatever I do with it, I'm going to be on my own, 

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I've never been enthusiastic about anything that involved effort, I've never really put effort into  anything  besides video games, I could easily do 24 or 48hours straight playing at the same game, but this has to do with dopamine releases off the charts that these games lead my brain to produce so that's that, but I've always considered quitting everything and keep playing video games at homes, just not to have to deal with this constant war of me with myself trying to get to work and maintain it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought the thing with technology and programming is that, I keep having that belief that there are A LOT of programmers and developers around the world which just decreases the value of that particular skill. And that It'd be better for me to just come up with ideas and pay people to execute them, and that If I don't come up with an extremely useful App or extension or whatever, I wouldn't be able to  make enough cash to make my dreams come true. Or just not fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I am still 19 and that I have time left, but I've always seen myself as being behind, 

I consider myself already at a loss of 1.5 years, I do think longterm wise, but still.

I will either have a friend write it or won't have it written at all and just publish the code in case someone wants to fork it and build a GUI version (idk if with what intention I have would make a difference)

Is there a concept of design for what I am talking about? How should I plan it out?

&lt;p&gt;I get that my code may have a bug, but wouldn’t it crash across all browsers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a “check list” I can run through?&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

This may be a sizeable post, I'm sorry in advance. But I have tried and tried for hours to make this work and I just can't, so I thought I'd ask for some help here. I am trying to create an app ([screenshot attached](https://imgur.com/a/w91V5Dw)) in which you choose an instrument, choose an audio compressor, then choose an amount, and it plays an audio file - all audio files have been processed in my studio, so I'm not trying to make it perform any Javascript audio processing magic! Through my limited knowledge of coding, I've used Javascript to set all this up. [I have included the code on this link](https://jsfiddle.net/te706dgr/), and will below explain it, to help you understand it so hopefully someone can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Explanation:

&amp;#x200B;

Variables are first declared - the instrument chosen by the dropdown at the top of the app, followed by the compressor chosen, then the amount of compression. The audio source is then declared, which will be changed later, as well as the current time in the song playing, to let us know how far into the song we are.

&amp;#x200B;

The first function instrumentDropdown\_change(event) takes the choice made on the dropdown at the top of the app and assigns that result to the ""instrument"" variable.

&lt;p&gt;YOU GUYS CAN DEFINITELY DO IT. I learned code through pure being pissed off something didn&amp;#39;t work even though it should. Y&amp;#39;all have interest, passion, and honestly more emotions to work with than blind anger at 2am swift coding. Since I need to fulfill the flair part of this rant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WANNA LEARN SWIFT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://books.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552""&gt;https://books.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book and the projects that go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://codewithchris.com/learn-swift/""&gt;https://codewithchris.com/learn-swift/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy helps when the books is skipping steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100""&gt;https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this stupid 100 days thing. It works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes there all fundementals. Then make this app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAkq4o8XgNw""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAkq4o8XgNw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There ya go. It took me 6 months to fix one app and make my own. Y&amp;#39;all can do it 4.&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"In the Basic JavaScript section from freeCodeCamp there is a lesson: ""Replace Loops using Recusion"", that I can't seem to wrap my head around. This isn't about recursion specifically, but the solution to the lesson. After a lot of head-scratching I was able to understand the basic principles of recursion, and I even came to the right answer. However, I do not understand why it's the right answer.

&amp;#x200B;

This lesson shows you how to rewrite a for loop as a recursive function and I can't understand how the answer is resolved to give the correct answers.

&amp;#x200B;

    function sum(arr, n) {
        if (n &lt;= 0)
            return 0;
        } else {
            return sum(arr, n - 1) + arr[n - 1];
        }
    }

The prompt:

Write a recursive function, `sum(arr, n)`, that returns the sum of the first `n` elements of an array `arr`.

&amp;#x200B;

`sum([1], 0) should equal 0`

`sum([2, 3, 4], 1) should equal 2`

`sum([2, 3, 4, 5], 3) should equal 9`

&amp;#x200B;

Using `sum([2, 3, 4], 1)` as an example I would assume:

1. n is greater than 0, go to else
2. return `sum([2, 3, 4], 1 - 1) + arr[1 - 1]`

,learnprogramming,"I have a feeling I'm going to get a lot of responses ""this is the way it's always been"" but I've noticed things changing and it's becoming a monotonous industry. 

Example, in a thriving industry, a job response can go something like this 

\-""can you write code? good. Can you start next week?"" 

\- ""but I don't even know what language or framework you're developing in?"" 

\- ""doesn't matter, we need guys and we need them now! We'll have our guys get you up to speed.""

In a dying industry the responses start to sound depressing 

""Well, you have a lot of Java experience and You've completed multiple back end projects for web but.. we're looking for someone who can build out our back end for mobile"". 

The hair splitting is exhausting. ""I'm going to focus my resume on specifically Python for tools programming working on AR applications"" there's one opening for that specific role and it's half way across the country but I'm only competing against 3 other guys"".

Then there's the tests. Where did these things come from and why are there now multiple online courses just to learn how to take a coding test. The tests keep growing and becoming more obscure. Early it was Fizz Buzz, now it's something that manages to combine palindromes with the Pythagorean theorem.

&lt;p&gt;Example, in a thriving industry, a job response can go something like this &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;quot;can you write code? good. Can you start next week?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &amp;quot;but I don&amp;#39;t even know what language or framework you&amp;#39;re developing in?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hair splitting is exhausting. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to focus my resume on specifically Python for tools programming working on AR applications&amp;quot; there&amp;#39;s one opening for that specific role and it&amp;#39;s half way across the country but I&amp;#39;m only competing against 3 other guys&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the tests. Where did these things come from and why are there now multiple online courses just to learn how to take a coding test. The tests keep growing and becoming more obscure. Early it was Fizz Buzz, now it&amp;#39;s something that manages to combine palindromes with the Pythagorean theorem. &amp;quot;This is something you might run into once a month so I&amp;#39;d like to see you solve this in 20 minutes while I breath heavily into the phone&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming," Hi,

If you have a good mood, don't read this. You have been warned.

I have been in the Android ecosystem for about 4 years now. And, never have I ever felt complete. First year was very solo for me. I developed two apps and published them. But, eventually, Play Store's policies became very restrictive about what I could do on Play Store. So, I had to take these apps down since they were useless now. This took my self confidence way low.

But, these apps got me a job as an Android Developer in the city. I worked with a company for about 3 years. I have learned a lot of things since then. I am able to distinguish what is good code and what is not. I have worked on about 12 apps full-time in my previous company. I am now working on a popular image/video app that requires me to constantly learn new stuff. I am very comfortable with this. I am able to write projects in MVP and MVVM and stay faithful to it. I adapted to Kotlin's syntax in about 2 weeks. I don't know if it was fast or slow. But, I struggle at Python just because I never made something in it. I have good knowledge of Haskell. I learned it in haste.

I see myself as a good developer (I really do). Not to the level of someone who majestically just type on the keyboard and it becomes the usual practice. Not Alt Jake W. or such either. Not like the people who keep devising new or better ways of using some code and post to twitter. I see myself as a developer who can write apps and learn the stuff if needed. But, these people, if they had seen my code, I can see them finding 100s of issues with the code. And, sometimes, they show us how Android's internal code isn't that good either. Everything seems so negative, so flawed that I question what is the benefit of learning anything.

Even if I learn a tool, its usage and implementation is going to change in future. I am not afraid of the change. But, how do I survive in the long run? Every weekend I see 100s of articles about 'do this', 'do this like this', 'forget this and do that', 'do new this'. While I try to learn as much as possible, there are more next weekend. I never had a programming class in my college. I think I might have knowledge gaps for the things I didn't learn. With the doubts about myself, I can never do anything big. I will never be able to contribute to this community when I can't even reach its potential. I think my life will be spent learning and running after these things. I mean how can I even pause someday and think I got it all now? Because that would be a lie, and still they tell you to live on.

I have started too many projects on my own, and I never finished them. They appeared so exciting when I started, but why does my will die after about 40% of the development? Is this how we are programmed? If others don't feel this, maybe I am not meant for this, I might have been good working on a farm. Challenges and learning curves would have been there. But, they would have excited me. Mentally I would be strong as something else. Now, I am cornered even when I am the only one in my home.

I work for a 9 - 6 job. Sometimes it is 9 - 8ish. This leaves me too little time to learn, practice or work on anything. I manage to take out 2 - 4 hours. Articles, Youtube tutorials, bad internet, slow system, weird build system errors take all of that away. My company said they would give me 2 hours daily for self growth when I joined. And, fool was I to believe so easily. Here isn't one day in these 6 months where I am not developing something, where I am not being asked questions upon questions, where I am not helping everyone about repository patterns, null safety and git. Again and again, I feel cheated. I feel like  some resource to extract values off of. Never have I been in any work environment where I could ask questions. A place where I can ask something and get a solid answer. How long can I keep walking on this road?

I have co-workers working even 9 - 9 sometimes. How do they seem so chill, when I am boiled up with so much frustration. How do they keep coming up every day with happy faces? Do they not worry about learning more? Are they content with what they know as long as it keeps them working on the job? Do they think they have someone to rely on?

What if someday my company asks me to do something and I can't do it? What if when I say I am a good developer and I can't prove it? What if they are expecting too much of me, do they know how little I know? They have hired some rookie in the getup of an android developer. l. When they look at me, do they know that I am a liar? Someday I am going to get found out at the new features and UX they call.

And, there are things I have been ignoring for two years. Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, Deep Learning?, Nano whatever? I thought I could go on avoiding these. I had no time, I had too much on my plate. Now, everything spoken or written is about them.

What are the bounds of this strange evil career I so easily took? Where are the milestones? Do I need to buy certifications to feel content, accepted and satisfied? What inspires one to keep trying and learning? How can I trap someone to extract values off? 

How do people get ideas? How do they get time? How do I keep up ignoring this ever-growing pressure of knowing/learning so little? How do they write so nice articles before the weekend? How do they think that they have found some hidden gems to write about it?  How can google ruin work by developers and push ahead without giving them a reason or chance? How can one bring up the courage to keep working? Where is your driving force? Lend me some.

I need to end this because this isn't going to end thisself. I need to be me. Would ‘me’ go on after I stop learning? No, I wouldn’t stop even if you tell me. I will write bad code. I will write shittiest shit of all the shits. You can call it whatever you want. You can twiddle your body on your chairs or beds writing those pesky articles. I will only learn what I want. I will look at your articles, and ignore them. I will look at your code, and find out your secrets for myself. So, keep your AR, AI, ML, DL, N-whatever in your pocket or wherever you want, you wouldn’t make any entry into my weekend to-learn list. I am not afraid of you,  I will take risks from now on. I am not going to be controlled.

,learnprogramming,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I'm a Senior CS student, just finishing up my last class before getting my degree, and for the past ~2 years I've hated pretty much every class I've taken. 

I've been continuing my classes despite how I feel simply because I have no desire to work in any other field, so I figured I may as well just finish my degree, but now that I'm so close to getting out, the dread is kind of getting worse because I've got my whole future ahead of me.

I've spoken to a lot of people in real life about this. It's not a secret that I hold in, and pretty much anyone who's asked me about my classes/future gets to know how I'm not excited at all about graduating, but none of the people I've spoken to have had any experience working in the field, and like 95%+ of the people I've spoken to about this have any experience at all with programming in general, so I generally just get platitudes, which don't really get me anywhere with my thoughts.

The real kicker is that I feel like I really enjoy programming. I kinda hate certain types of debugging, but sometimes even debugging can be satisfying. Every now and then I'll think of a project I want to make and I'll do it and put it on my GitHub and show them to people, and the people I show tend to enjoy what I work on as well. I also really enjoy working with people. Like, a lot. My all time favorite class was a class about the software lifecycle which was just two exams and two 4.5 week group projects, and I had a lot of fun working with my groups.

So there's this huge conflict of feelings about this field that I don't really know how to resolve because I'm working off of incomplete information since I have literally no idea what it's like to have a CS job. I both hate my degree because I am getting basically no joy out of studying and doing the assignments and attending classes, but at the same time, I feel like I enjoy the parts of programming that matter for my future, but also at the same time I'm not sure if that matters.

edit: Forgot to mention something that might be relevant. I also am very conflicted about another matter entirely. The field I think I consistently enjoy the most is machine learning, but I don't know if I'm cut out for that work. I did end up going for a math minor with my degree, which I've already satisfied, but even with that minor I don't feel qualified at all for doing machine learning since it always seems very heavy in math. I'll usually understand the mathy bits when presented with it, but I don't know if I have the chops to do something with it in the real world.

I don't have a CS degree and I work in finance, so this is a totally new interest for me. A few weeks ago I finally put my excuses aside and decided to jump in.

4.

SOLVED: Thank you u/marineabcd The issue was simply an indentation problem :) Here is the correct code:

    for event in dev.read_loop():
      if event.type == ecodes.EV_KEY:
        key = categorize(event)
        if key.keystate == key.key_down:
            if key.keycode == 'KEY_1':

Although I am unsure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import os
from evdev import InputDevice, categorize, ecodes
dev = InputDevice(&amp;#39;/dev/input/event7&amp;#39;)
dev.grab()

for event in dev.read_loop():
  if event.type == ecodes.EV_KEY:
     key = categorize(event)
  if key.keystate == key.key_down:
    if key.keycode == &amp;#39;KEY_ESC&amp;#39;:
      os.system(&amp;#39;echo Hello World&amp;#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get the keyboards ID and running  some code display key values but this doesn&amp;#39;t work. Here is the error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Apologies if this has been answered before, I have used the search function but couldn't find anything clear.

The advice out there points to learning Java for Android apps, and Swift for iOS. However, what would you advise I learn if I'm a complete newbie to app development, and have a goal project in mind that I want to build for Android and iOS at the same time?

Is there any pitfalls to avoid, or can one code base be fairly easily configured for the other platform? Ideally I want to know the best learning course of action so that I can avoid learning *only* one language e.g. Java, and then having to go all the way back to square one for Swift.

,learnprogramming,"Hi,

I have almost finished CS50 course and while using the IDE was comfortable I have decided to set up everything on my computer so after finishing the course I can work on some own projects.

But after spending a couple of hours to get some basics done, I still run into errors and issues.

I have ordered a new laptop, which will hopefully arrive in 2 weeks. So until then I would like to learn more about how to properly set up the environment that I am going to work in.

Here are just a few things that I ran into:

* PostgreSQL: After spending some time setting it up locally, it always gave an error that my password is not correct
* Python: I had an old version of Python installed (2.7) and it did not matter that I installed the latest I always ran into problems. For example Pip was always installed into the old directory. Finally I could delete 2.7.
* Flask: installed flask and a couple of other things that I knew I would need, but I can't start it. In one case it says the application can't even import Flask. In other cases there are 5-10 lines of error.

I am not expecting troubleshooting, but rather a few tips on where to start when I want to learn about setting up the environment. For example a good guide on PATH, environment variables, virtual environments etc. Anything you think could be useful.

Currently I have a very old Macbook Pro, but I will work on Linux and/or Windows (as the new Macbook Pros were out of my budget).

I know very basic programming skills since I'm SysAdmin. But I believe it's a good opportunity to learn and evolve my skills.

The basic feature is to set the plan of your workout beforehand, not only the interval between the exercises, but including the name of the exercises, that will be displayed during the workout, eliminating any distraction.

Very simple and straightforward.

Are they just returning the sum and turning it into a string? Whats the 2? And what does this have to do with binary?.

,learnprogramming,"Hello pro coders, I have a hard to handle data file I am trying to import using python. Due to NDA's I unfortunately cannot reveal the data. Here is an example of what I am dealing with.

Header group 1
AA value1 20
AA value2 25
AA value3 30

Header group 2
AA value1 10



So basically the values after header group 1, and prior to header group 2 belong to group 1. If this were a normal data file it should look something like this:

Header                       AA             Value
Group 1             value1           20

Group 1             value3           30
Group 2             value1           10


To further clarify there is a fixed width dependent upon the start of each row. If it starts with header i may need to pull the data from positions 10-15. If it starts with AA i may need to pull positions 20-30 and 40-50. Also all values between HH records.


Please help me with how to identify this format and possibly import it into a pandas dataframe.

- What should I focus my unit tests on? Controllers? Models? Helper functions? A little of everything?
- Got any ""pro tips"" for organizing code to be unit test friendly? Write small methods? Never use globals and static methods, so that all input and dependencies enter via the method parameters?
- How much time/code coverage should I spend on this? Does every method and function need multiple test cases? Should I just focus on certain methods? How do I know which to focus on?
- Should private methods be unit tested?
- My current testing is a browser plugin similar to Selenium. It simulates a user navigating through the website, submitting forms, etc. using a script I wrote. This incorporates and tests everything together: the view, the database, etc. PHP errors and/or failing some manual checks I do after the script runs = fail, I go and fix things, then I run the test again.

Hello everyone,

   
 

first of all, sorry for bringing a topic that you guys are probably tired of hearing and talking about.

   
 

I am 26, and I have an MBA, but would like to redirect toward IT. I have been learning python for a few months now, and I feel like I am not going anywhere. Precisely, I don’t feel like if I keep studying by myself I will be ready for job interviews until years.

I have been considering going back to school to get a bachelor degree in cs,(I would like to work in software development) but both the time and financial resources are too heavy for me. (I am married my wife is ready to start a family so I cant be afford to be out of revenue for 2year+)

So I have been considering bootcamps. I don’t see bootcamps as something that will get me a job right away, but something that will turn me from “ a toddler eating paint” to “ someone with paint, brushes, a canvas and who can start painting”.  

Now my problem is that there are a lot of bootcamps and I am lost. Between the scams, the expensive etc I was wondering if, 1) I could get an opinion regarding everything I just say (my situation), 2) true bootcamp, what to do, what to pick and donts.

In addition, I am living in Kentucky, so I was wondering if bootcamps are better in person or if online is fine. I really want to succeed so if I need to relocate for few months in order to do that in the best condition I will. 

Thank you for anyone who could provide an insight and help me! I know the subject have already been talked about on this sub but most of the post are +2 years old and things have evolved (new bootcamps emerged, so more it’s even harder to find the good from the scam)

Wanted to try switching groups around, from lastname, firstname to firstname lastname.  So my list looks like this:

**Belligono,** **Stan**

**Arigoto,** **Domo**

I used this expression: (\[\\w\\,\])(\[\\{b,s}\\w+\\{b,s\])

I moved the first line around to other lines, didn't change anything; also added extra letters to the other first names, and those didn't highlight, either (for example, **Domo**a.) So it's not going beyond four letters in the first names, and I don't know why.

Plus that first comma being left out, that's especially baffling!

Oooh, wait, I just played around a bit some more and seem to have solved it (not sure \*why\*):

(\[\\w\\,\])**+**(\[\\{b,s}\\w+\\{b,s\]) &lt;- added the ""+"" between the first two groups. :-D This is why I like regex, it's like a word puzzle. At least, at this level.

The array is printing out elements vertically but sometimes (since its random) it shows a blank line where the fourth element would print for example.

Here is the output:

**TL;DR** : Wanting to make a web app where people kinda share and update a UI where they can send data to each other but having a hard time seeing where to start.

So, I wanted to start a personal project this summer of a D&amp;D web application. This last semester I began working in React and really liked it and want to keep building on that but also learn more on back-end and database ( I've had some brief experience in both but want to really dig in now ). 

The idea of the application is for people to join and communicate for a D&amp;D session as well as make the DM's job somewhat easier. If you're familiar with D&amp;D then you might also be familiar with Roll20 which is kinda a similar way of thinking about it. If not, then to clarify you have one person basically in control of the game and then other players join in to cooperate under said person's (Dungeon Master) control. The DM will manipulate the UI seen to the players and send data to the players often, such as maybe images for instance. The players would also have the ability to communicate via chat. These are just some of the features, I don't have them all mapped out yet, but I wanted to do research into how this could work before I entirely dig in. 

In terms of technologies, I was thinking React (as mentioned above), Redux, Express.js, and probably MySQL for starts (considering an ORM tool like Sequelize). The main barrier I'm seeing is that I don't have much experience with the networking portion and need some direction on where to start this idea of having multiple people join a game 'session', send data to one another, and then saving the state of that 'session' for later pickup. I've read up in some places, but I'm just not aware where the right place to start is.

Let's say I generate some random terrain. I want each tile to have a 1/10 chance of having a tree on it. I can use the tile's position in order to generate a seed, but beyond that, I don't feel confident that the properties I generate using that seed will vary enough from tile to tile.

If the first number I generate using this represents the chances of a tree spawning, no trees will spawn because the top row is less than 1/2 (i.e. all spaces). If I use the second number, there will be a not so random distribution of trees. Tree tree no tree no tree etc.

Basically, I need a map where the key is given `GUID` and the value is a member function of `MyClass`, which is a factory method for instances of derived classes of `BaseClass`, returned as a BaseClass pointer.

    map[classGuid] = std::bind&lt;BaseClass*&gt;(&amp;MyClass::createInstance&lt;DerivedClassX&gt;, this, std::placeholders::_3);

Class `MyClass` is a singleton, so it is filled just once.  
Code doesn't show any errors, but when compiled, MSVS2019 throws following errors:

    using bind_eq = decltype(std::bind&lt;BaseClass*&gt;(std::declval&lt;plain_fnc&gt;(),

    bind_eq factory = std::bind&lt;BaseClass*&gt;(&amp;MyClass::createInstance&lt;DerivedClassX&gt;, this, std::placeholders::_3);
    map[classGuid] = factory;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;std::invoke&amp;#39;: no matching overloaded function found&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even tried doing something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using plain_fnc = BaseClass* (MyClass::*)(ClassX*, ClassY*, const GUID*);
using bind_eq = decltype(std::bind&amp;lt;BaseClass*&amp;gt;(std::declval&amp;lt;plain_fnc&amp;gt;(),
    std::declval&amp;lt;MyClass*&amp;gt;(), std::declval&amp;lt;const decltype(
    std::placeholders::_3)&amp;amp;&amp;gt;()));

bind_eq factory = std::bind&amp;lt;BaseClass*&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;MyClass::createInstance&amp;lt;DerivedClassX&amp;gt;, this, std::placeholders::_3);
map[classGuid] = factory;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, which also doesn&amp;#39;t show any errors, but ends with the same result when compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours trying to solve this, but have no clue what could be the issue.&lt;br/&gt;
Any help/tips greatly appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Hey guys,

So I’m currently trying to learn Javascript mainly, though I am also improving my CSS and HTML skills (so all frontend for now).
I am working on the odin project, though also freecodecamp.(And sometimes I use W3schools as a reference)

However, I’ve been wondering whether I am really learning most effectively.
I try to do projects all the time, in order to practice, but I notice that I tend to look up a lot of stuff (as I am not that good yet).
Now because of that I kinda have the feeling that I might be relying too much on external references... And feel as if I am “cheating” so to say

My question is whether this is normal at the beginning or if I should perhaps try to learn differently for more effectivity? I just feel a bit as if I stagnate, in the sense that I just end up looking up a lot of stuff, perhaps not truly learning much in the process.

Overall I’m interested on how some of you guys learned this stuff, and what you think are good ways to improve my skills?
Do you think that just doing projects is the most important part, even though I might end up looking up a lot of stuff?

Perhaps you have some general tips as well for me, as I am quite at the beginning still.

Why is so? 

From what i looked at of the C++ looks extremelly complex to learn. And it makes me kind of scared that it will make me feel unmotivated. Because a lot of the motivation in learning comes from the gratification of doing something practical with it soon.

I learned Javascript and it seems fairly easy to get a grasp of what is happening in C# and other languages.

So on one hand i have all these people saying: Learn C++ first, and you will be able to understand every other language. On the other hand i have all other people saying, ""Dont do that, you should first learn an easy language like C# or Python.""

,learnprogramming,"So I am learning Java for my AP computer programming class and an example program shows an example of polymorphism. The program has a super class file *Shape.java* :

    public abstract class Shape
    {
        private String name;
        
        public Shape(String name)
        {
            this.name = name;

            return this.name;
        }
        
        public abstract double getArea();
    }
    

And it also has subclasses of *Circle.java**,* *Ellipse.java*, etc. But for this example the rectangle class is used:

    public class Rectangle extends Shape
    {
        private double width;
        private double height;
        
        public Rectangle(String name, double width, double height)
        {
            super(name);
            this.width = width;
            this.height = height;
        }
        
        public Rectangle(double width, double height)
        {
            this(""Rectangle"", width, height);
        }
        
        public double getArea()
        {
            return width * height;
        }
        
        public double getHeight()
        {
            return height;
        }
        
        public double getWidth()
        {
            return width;
        }

        {
            return ""Rectangle with width: "" + width + "" and height: "" + height;
        }
    }
    

And this is the file that runs through the console.

    public class ShapesTester extends ConsoleProgram
    {
        public void run()
        {
            Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
            System.out.println(rectangle.getName());
            // This is an example of Polymorphism 
            // The right method to call is figured out
            // at run-time.
            System.out.println(rectangle.getArea());
            
            Shape circle = new Circle(10);
            System.out.println(circle.getName());
            System.out.println(circle.getArea());
            
            Shape ellipse = new Ellipse(5, 4);
            System.out.println(ellipse.getName());
            System.out.println(ellipse.getArea());
            
            Shape square = new Square(6);
            System.out.println(square.getName());
            System.out.println(square.getArea());
            
        }
    }
    

My first question is; (a) how do we know which state of the object is called? If I didn't have the superclass called and instead made an object without calling the superclass. For example:

    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
    System.out.println(rectangle.getName());

,learnprogramming,"I'm a reasonably experienced programmer, but for this problem I'm not sure where to start and Google doesn't help much.

I have a large database of tiny images (around 50 million, each image is 40,000 pixels total), all the exact same size and all square. Each image record also has a tiny amount of metadata. What I want is an algorthm to take a user-defined selection of these images (order of 50,000 for 99% of cases, should handle larger but need not be fast for much beyond this) and combine them into one. The combining is very simple, no overlap or gaps and the logic for deciding where each small one fits in is very simple.

I've written something in python that works perfectly, by simply looping through the list of images to be added and pasting them onto the single image one at a time. The problem is that it takes ages (10+ minutes) to run. I'd like to make this as fast as possible. Memory isn't much of an issue here, there is enough to store any size image I could possibly want to create.

What I'm looking for is a general algorithm to handle this as efficiently as possible. Is there anything quicker than just creating a blank image of the required size and pasting each small image in one by one? Maybe somehow do it all in parallel?

Also looking for a language to write this in, python will obviously be very slow. Obvious choices are C, C++, and Rust, but I don't know anything about their image handling or suitability.

**Problem:** Choropleth map overlay to show median housing cost difference not showing

I'm trying to find out which key_on parameter to focus on during a GEOjson query to identify certain zip codes within a map overlay by choropleth coloring.

Currently, the focus has been `key_on='feature.properties.zipcode'`, but this has not colored the map correctly.

I think that I've got a solid code backing this up, as everything prints out to a map (including markers). However, choropleth coloring is not popping up.

So, my questions are: Am I targeting the correct GEOJson parameter? If not, how can I drill down to the correct parameter? Is there a difference in using a GEOJson vs a json?

I apologize for not providing a ""running"" code due to the data being missing, but the code is as follows:

    !wget --quiet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-mos-def/DataFiles/master/austin_area_zip_codes.geojson

&lt;p&gt;As I do a lot of beginner projects these terms and phrases pop up intermittently and when I look them up it&amp;#39;s usually a basic definition that doesn&amp;#39;t explain the how/why so I get discouraged. As I type this out I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself maybe I lack basic computer literacy or an understanding of computer science but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I need to dive deep into the science of it for what I want to achieve (basic automation projects etc.). Does anyone have any input or resources so that I can wrap my head around these concepts?&lt;/p&gt;

I would prefer a beginner and would be really happy if some one who is already programming can talk with us and something like teach.&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"I was watching a video by Kevin Naughton Jr, and he gave the clearest analogy for recursion I have ever seen in my entire life.

Imagine you magically teleport into a movie theater and are placed in some arbitrary row. The seats in front of you are just high enough so that you cant see how many rows are in front of you.

How do you figure out what row you are in?

Tap the guy in front of you and ask him what row he is in and add 1 (1 row higher than the person in front). If he doesn't know, he will tap the person in front of him for his row. If the person in front of him doesn't know, he will ask the person in front of him... This will keep going on until you get to the person in the very first row of the theater and he will definitely know that he is in row 1, so he will tell the guy behind him that he is in row 1 and now the guy behind him knows he is in row 2. He tells the guy behind him that he is in row 2, so the guy behind knows that he is in row 3. As you keep going up the row starting from n, the guy above is in row n+1.

This is exactly how recursion works. You have a method that may not give an exact answer yet, so it will recursively call the method again (usually with the input size being a little smaller) until the input meets some condition in the base case where it will return its value, and the calls behind it will each bubble up with its respective value until you reach the initial method call.

,learnprogramming," If you're looking to learn web development, you need to learn at least some JavaScript. And if you're learning JavaScript to build a website that talks to a backend or other API, you'll need to learn about Promises.

A Promise is an object that's built into JavaScript which is a kind of stand-in for a value that will eventually be resolved (say, from an API call).  You can interact with Promises using promise chaining (the .then() syntax) or the newer async/await. 

If you're interested in a more detailed explanation with examples, here's a video that explains the basics of Promises in 3 minutes:

I know some people will even find this post offensive (even though I'm not trying to be, nor am I trying to insinuate that programming is ""bad"" or anything like that), but most of what I say here is just MY opinion, and not some kind of irrational rant or anything like that.

So, I'm on my second year in Computer Science, and so far it's been great - first year it was all about concepts, such as logic gates, basic HTML and CSS (which by far was my favorite subject, and one that I did very well), and basic C. So far so great, I'm on my second year, and all I'm having now is frustration. I'm learning Data Structures, which so far involved a lot of C and sorting algorithms, hashing, etc etc, but I admit that I don't like it at all. It's fun, and it's nice to get that huge code done and look at it and be like ""damn, I made it"", so I never actually skip on any assignment or anything like that (in fact, all my friends rely on me when they need help)... HOWEVER, I honestly don't see myself doing ""this"" kind of thing my whole life (and by this I mean, coding and coding in front of a text editor or IDE all day without even seeing any aesthetic results from my work). And I know what you're thinking, ""if you don't like coding then why are you in comp sci in the first place"" well here's the thing, it's not that I don't like ""coding"", it's just that I'm a very creative-driven person, and when it comes to programming and stuff like that, the thing I love the most (by far) is the design (or the UI), and this is why I said that my favorite subject was HTML/CSS on my first year. Now, I pretty much know what I ""want"" when it comes to a career itself. I want something more creative and less ""logical"" if that makes sense. Not something that I'll have to sit in front of the computer for hours staring at this huge wall of text and figuring out 'why my equation is giving me the wrong results', but rather something where I can apply the knowledge I already have when it comes to design (I did a technical course on design before, and I also used to work free-lance with advertisement) without caring too much about the ""logic"" itself. I don't mind sitting in front of an IDE, it's just I don't want to be the guy who does the back-end stuff, but more like the front-end stuff.

In fact, if I'm going to be reallyyyy honest here, I'm only studying Computer Science so I can earn some money when I graduate, because what I REALLY want is to pursue a career in music or visual arts (preferably both), but I currently live in a third-world country (and I'm unemployed myself), so this kind of ""dream"" is basically a no-no atm (let's say I have to be more 'practical' at least until I have a stable job/income/life). So if I'm really going to continue with this whole comp sci thing, at least I want to do something more ""relatable"" to me, which atm seems to be Web Design. But what I really want to know is, will there be opportunities for me in the market, if I decide to learn technologies such as React.js, Angular, etc? Do you guys suggest any other career inside comp sci (other than Web Design) for me (based on my post)?

,learnprogramming,"Hello! I've been using WordPress a lot lately and I really like it's DB schema because it is very flexible. 

My question is not WordPress-focused as I'm just using it as an example. For those of you who aren't familiar with the schema, check it out:  [https://codex.wordpress.org/Database\_Description](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) 

This is the way I see some of the tables:

**wp\_users:** primitive data of all users. (id, username, email, password, etc...)

**wp\_usermeta:** any non-primitive user data field. 

**wp\_posts:** primitive data of all posts(id, author, title, date, etc...)

**wp\_postmeta:** any non-primitive post data field. 

**wp\_terms:** I see terms as fields that add context to an object, like a category for a post.

**wp\_term\_taxonomy:** it groups terms into a taxonomy. An example would be categories. 'Category' is the taxonomy and 'travel', 'finance', 'lifestyle' would be the terms of that taxonomy.

**wp\_term\_relationships:** it links a term to an object (like a post)

So, WordPress has more tables but for the sake of this question they aren't necessary to mention. 

Let's say I'm building an app for companies to manage expired payments. The app will need:

&amp;#x200B;

**1 - Users with different roles, capabilities and fields:**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Role 1 (Company Manager):** Represents a manager of the financial department of a company.
   * **Capability 1**: Create, edit and delete users with the 'Payment Department' role.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Role 2 (Payment Deparment):** Represents a department that handles these expired payments. It could be an internal department of the company or an external contractor. 
   * **Capability 1:** Create payments.
   * **Capability 2:** Create, edit and delete users with the 'Employee' role.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Role 3 (Employee):** Represents an employee of the Payment Department that will list and update status of the payments.
   * **Capability 1:** List payments created by his parent Payment Department.
   * **Capability 2:** Update a payment status.

&amp;#x200B;

**2 - Payments status management.**

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very basic example but let's say I'm creating this app from zero and I have to define a DB schema. I think a schema like the one WordPress has would fit it perfectly and even allow it to grow later in case more functionalities are needed.

&amp;#x200B;

* A payment could be represented by a 'wp\_post'.
* The payment status can be a term under a taxonomy called 'Status'.
* We can treat any role-specific user field as a meta field (for example the Payment Department Tax ID)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that classes are nothing more than syntactical sugar in Javascript for prototypical inheritance, but I think of this question as language agnostic; it's really just a question about OOP in general.

I'm creating a utility to help convert nutritional information amounts into a percent daily value. For example, a protein bar has 11g of protein. What percent of your daily value of protein is 11g? So far, I have:

            this.DV = {

                // etc.
            }
        }

            // convert

    }

My questions:

1. Is this just a bad example of when to use classes?
2. Should all methods in this class be static instead? It doesn't make sense to me to instantiate a new instance of DailyValue, it makes more sense to say `DailyValue.getPercentDV(""PROTEIN"", 5, ""g"")`

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m creating a utility to help convert nutritional information amounts into a percent daily value. For example, a protein bar has 11g of protein. What percent of your daily value of protein is 11g? So far, I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class DailyValue {
    constructor () {
        this.DV = {
            PROTEIN: {
                amount: 50,
                units: &amp;quot;g&amp;quot;,
            },
            CHOLESTEROL: {
                amount: 300,
                unit: &amp;quot;mg&amp;quot;,
            },
            // etc.
        }
    }

    getPercentDV (
        nutrient/*: String */,
        amount/*: Number */,
        unit/*: String */,
    )/*: Number */ {
        // take input
        // compare units
        // convert
        // calculate
        // return percent
    }

    convertUnits (
        amount/*: Number */, 
        isUnit/*: String */, 
        toUnit/*: String */
    ) {
        // This would actually look something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-units so I would probably write it as a new module instead. 
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this just a bad example of when to use classes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should all methods in this class be static instead? It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me to instantiate a new instance of DailyValue, it makes more sense to say &lt;code&gt;DailyValue.getPercentDV(&amp;quot;PROTEIN&amp;quot;, 5, &amp;quot;g&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,learnprogramming,"Hey guys,
So I’m a college freshman, and have been taking programming classes since junior year in high school. I loved the aspect of building things from scratch, and I was always thinking “wow, I wonder what’s going on under the hood of X program/game/website”. Of course there were projects that took a lot of trial and error and I got through those feeling stronger than before. Now due to COVID-19 I’m doing all classes from home, without some of the support systems available at my school. Long story short, one of the coding projects was to make a “wall hugging” algorithm to get through a maze using a stack. I knew it would be challenging, but something about this project just killed my passion for programming. My friends and I spent 20+ hours over the course of 2 days just trying to figure out one bug, and in the process of hours and hours of trial and error with the same error almost every time (segmentation fault) it was my friends doing most of the heavy lifting even with me trying my best to contribute. I wanted to help out and understand more but I just had no clue what was going on, and when the solution was finally figured out it wasn’t satisfying like it used to be. It was my friend who found the solution and I didn’t know why it worked and had stopped really understanding the code hours before this, even when he explained it to me.  I had a breakdown afterwards since we came so close to not finishing it and it was worth like 70% of our grade, and the 10 hour grind sessions really wore me down. Combine that with the fact I might not even pass my discrete math class requires to move on to the next coding course and you can see why I’m feeling pretty shitty. Now whenever I think of programming all that I think about is not being able to figure out that issue and those grueling grind sessions. That initial curiosity of what goes on behind the scenes of applications is gone, and has been replaced by intimidation.

I am looking for the optimal strategy for the following game:

1. You are in a room and you need to go through n doors to leave.
2. At this innermost room you can pick up coins but you can at the most carry 4 coins at once.
3. Each time you pass a door (forwards or backwards) you need to pay the door guard 1 coin.
4. You can leave an unlimited number of coins with any guard.
5. At the least, how many coins must there be in the first room to leave?

I am specifically looking for a solution if n=9. if n&lt;5 its trivial. n=5 must be 7 coins and for n=6 I get 12 coins. With the strategy I used, I get 123 coins for n=9 but this does not seem to be the right answer. Might have bugs in my code or it's simply not the best strategy

## Quick start:

1. New to programming? Not sure how to start learning? See [FAQ - Getting started][faq-start].
2. Have a question? Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.
3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:

## Getting debugging help

If your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:

1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].
2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.
4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.
5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.

Do your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.

Also see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!

## Asking conceptual questions

Asking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.

If you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.

## Subreddit rules

Please read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting. If you see somebody breaking a rule, report it! Reports and PMs to the mod team are the quickest ways to bring issues to our attention.

,learnprogramming,"I'm a web developer and I hate it.

I enjoyed learning how to code and making my own projects. It was fun, but ever since I got a job as an actual web developer (full stack) , I've slowly started to realize I messed up. Here is my list of reasons

1. There is no creativity. Management tells you what needs to be done, what frameworks and languages to use, etc.. you simply follow orders and listen.
2. There is extremely little ""original coding"". By that, I mean all you basically do is glue API's, libraries and services together. You hardly ever code anything from the ground up.
3. A few of my other friends got into artificial intelligence, machine learning, embedded systems, etc. They are working on SUPER COOL stuff. I'm jealous. One of my friends who is an embedded engineer is now programming medical devices that screen for a bunch of stuff (cancer, etc).. like that is world changing stuff.. here I am gluing API's together for businesses?? Another friend is a data engineer who prepares all the data infrastructure to be used by biologists who are doing ground-breaking research on deadly diseases (including covid-19). One more who is working in game development, and creating video game engines in C++ and using a lot of math and physics. Ugh, I just think there are so many interesting areas of CS and web dev is the worst one. 
4. Everyone is going into web development these days, I fear that with all this competition there is going to be a huge saturation, and possibly wage decreases as time goes on

As a warning ahead of time, this is a bit of a wall of text, talking about stuff that is a little bit closer to the metal than most beginners are familiar with (at least I was). I try to keep it simple and high-concept level, but the fundamental issue does mean I need to talk about memory management a little bit. I hope I explain the concept simple enough that you can follow along even if you have never worked in a language with manual memory management. I also talk about a thing YOU can do better, rather than your code, that I hope people take to heart as a great practice to speed up development of anything you work on in the future, including languages that work at a much higher level.

----

To set the scene, the young and foolishly optimistic beginner developer tries his hand at crafting a voxel world. Using [an extremely useful free online guide](https://learnopengl.com/) (I swear this isn't an ad, that guide was just super good for me, and I highly recommend it for anyone else interested in openGL with C++) he gets pretty far pretty quickly, and the cube in front of him is rendered beautifully ^(after the 8th try). Satisfied and confident in his skills, he reaches for the skies and renders two cubes at the same time! Still rendering beautifully. 4. 8. 16. 16 x 16. 

At this point, my framerate starts to fall, but the answer is clearly available. All the tutorials say to construct a VBO for multiple objects at once, and render the whole collection in one go, rather than one cube at a time. After some shenanigans, the solution to which was easily tracked down, the 16x16 scene is rendered fast and beautifully. So once again our overconfident developer scales up. 32x32. 64x64. 128x128.

But now the framerate is dropping again. Has he reached his GPU's limit? There are 16 384 cubes in his world, for a total of 589 824 vertices to render. Is that too much? Everyone online says no, a modern GPU can render billions of vertices, so half a million should be trivial.

So it must be a CPU problem, no? The profiler does say the CPU is the bottleneck, but the code ran every frame is relatively simple.

    for (auto mesh : meshes) {  
        mesh.Draw(shader);  
    }

Note that the `meshes` vector only contains a single `mesh` object, which simply manages the only VAO/VBO in the scene, and stores a copy of all the floats (of which there are 4 718 592, amounting to 18 MB raw) that the GPU was sent once during the setup. And no, I was not sending all vertex data every frame, that I saw ahead of time was a bad idea. This is more subtle than that.

Now, those who know C++ well can already understand exactly why I am only getting 15 FPS for what amounts to a very simple scene. But coming from python, I had no idea what was causing the CPU to be this slow. So rather than take a closer look at my CPU profiler data, I took the stupid-headed approach of manually searching through my codebase for optimization problems

----

**Side track for another beginner-type performance mistake in C++**

So I started to track down possible issues. One thing I encountered was that I was storing my block data in a struct like this:  

    struct Block{  
        glm::vec3 position;  
        std::string type;  
    };

    //usage example
    Block grassBlock = Block{ position, ""grass"" };

Pro tip: don't use strings for high-quantity often-copied objects. Replacing this with an enum class for the types of blocks massively sped up my load times. Copying strings is very expensive because it has to allocate much more memory than a simple int, but it performs the exact same task of identification that an int could do^(*edit: better explanation of why it is expensive to use strings.*). By using enum classes, you can use keywords that make sense to you, while the compiler can just replace those with ints that the computer can work much easier with. Never use strings to identify classes or types of things. Use enums.

*Edit: I used the wrong syntax here, and should let the compiler figure out the int values rather than hardcoding them. Thanks to /u/BODAND for pointing this out to me.*

    enum class blockType : int{
        grass,
        dirt,
        /*etc*/
     };

    struct Block{
        glm::vec3 position;
        blockType type;
    };

    //usage example
    Block grassBlock = Block{ position, blockType::grass };

 This optimisation isn't the point of this post, but it is also another thing you should be aware of when working with lower level languages.

----

But I was still having horrible frame times (~0.05 s per frame) during the scene rendering itself. After I spent days stuck on this issue, I used a performance analyser to tell me what function my program spent the most time executing. And I felt the most relieved and ashamed at the same time I ever had when I saw where 78.98% of my CPU time was spent.

If you know C++, you probably saw this coming from the title. If you don't, pay attention. The performance analyser showed that the function `std::vector&lt;Vertex, std::allocator&lt;Vertex&gt;&gt;` took up 78.98% of my CPU time. But how, I wondered? Where am I calling this function that much? My `Mesh::Draw` function simply instructs openGL to draw the VAO, it doesn't copy vectors. But it wasn't the draw function that was the issue. It was the for loop itself. Now for the ""horror"" part of the title:

----

#&gt;!It copied the mesh object, including all 18 megabytes of vertex data, every frame.!&lt;

----

To explain what happened to those who don't know, in C++ values are copied by default. If I say

    int a = 1;
    int b = a;

then a and b both store the value 1, independently. The same is true of bigger objects, like my mesh object. So when I said

    for (auto mesh : meshes){
        mesh.Draw(shader);
    }

what my compiler understood was essentially (in english code):

    for each mesh:
        reserve memory space of size of mesh (which is ~18 MB)
        make local copy of mesh to that memory space
        call Draw() on the copy with argument shader


One small adjustment later:

    for (auto &amp;mesh : meshes){
        mesh.Draw(shader);
    }

and my compiler understands:

    for each mesh:
        call Draw() on that mesh with argument shader

which was my intention to start with. But because I didn't use the reference character `&amp;`, my compiler went with the default option of copying the value, which meant my CPU was spending each and every frame duplicating 18 megabytes. Reserving 18 megabytes of RAM was the biggest part of that step. All of it completely useless, since that data is a local variable to the for loop, which means it gets effectively removed again every cycle of the for loop, every frame.

With the optimisation in place, my frame time was down to 0.0083 s per frame, capped to my monitor's 120 FPS limit, an improvement of factor &gt; 6, (and probably much much more, but my FPS cap doesn't show that).

There are many more improvements I can make, of course. But this was the kind of problem I wasn't even considering, since the languages I already knew used references by default. If you ever find yourself working in C++ for anything where performance matters, always check to see if you are using references where you should.

----

But in another way, there is a bigger optimisation lesson here: I was trying to optimise manually. Don't do that. If I was using a performance analyser from the start I wouldn't have spent days working on functions that weren't the problem in the first place. The problem wasn't even any of my functions or methods, it was my syntax. **Just because there is no syntax error doesn't mean your syntax isn't wrong.** It is tempting for new programmers to think they understand their own code. You don't. Especially in bigger programs, it can become easily impossible to know what your program is struggling with, and what it doesn't care about. Strings are such a thing that a computer finds far harder to use than you might expect. But knowing what things a computer finds hard, especially if you are working with custom data types or functions where you can't google if it is fast or slow, is almost impossible to accurately predict.

Yes, my program was wasting dozens of milliseconds copying megabytes. But I was wasting days not using a performance analyser. Had I used it from the start, I would have understood that there was something very wrong with my for loop, and found the issue in an hour at most. Instead, I tried to optimise code I hadn't measured and wasted my own time, which in a way is much more valuable than my program's frame rate. Measure your program when you are having performance issues, take this lesson for free from someone who has learned it the hard way.

&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;meshes&lt;/code&gt; vector only contains a single &lt;code&gt;mesh&lt;/code&gt; object, which simply manages the only VAO/VBO in the scene, and stores a copy of all the floats (of which there are 4 718 592, amounting to 18 MB raw) that the GPU was sent once during the setup. And no, I was not sending all vertex data every frame, that I saw ahead of time was a bad idea. This is more subtle than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, those who know C++ well can already understand exactly why I am only getting 15 FPS for what amounts to a very simple scene. But coming from python, I had no idea what was causing the CPU to be this slow. So rather than take a closer look at my CPU profiler data, I took the stupid-headed approach of manually searching through my codebase for optimization problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side track for another beginner-type performance mistake in C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started to track down possible issues. One thing I encountered was that I was storing my block data in a struct like this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Block{  
    glm::vec3 position;  
    std::string type;  
};

//usage example
Block grassBlock = Block{ position, &amp;quot;grass&amp;quot; };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: don&amp;#39;t use strings for high-quantity often-copied objects. Replacing this with an enum class for the types of blocks massively sped up my load times. Copying strings is very expensive because it has to allocate much more memory than a simple int, but it performs the exact same task of identification that an int could do&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: better explanation of why it is expensive to use strings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. By using enum classes, you can use keywords that make sense to you, while the compiler can just replace those with ints that the computer can work much easier with. Never use strings to identify classes or types of things. Use enums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I used the wrong syntax here, and should let the compiler figure out the int values rather than hardcoding them. Thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/BODAND""&gt;/u/BODAND&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum class blockType : int{
    grass,
    dirt,
    /*etc*/
 };

struct Block{
    glm::vec3 position;
    blockType type;
};

//usage example
Block grassBlock = Block{ position, blockType::grass };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This optimisation isn&amp;#39;t the point of this post, but it is also another thing you should be aware of when working with lower level languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was still having horrible frame times (~0.05 s per frame) during the scene rendering itself. After I spent days stuck on this issue, I used a performance analyser to tell me what function my program spent the most time executing. And I felt the most relieved and ashamed at the same time I ever had when I saw where 78.98% of my CPU time was spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know C++, you probably saw this coming from the title. If you don&amp;#39;t, pay attention. The performance analyser showed that the function &lt;code&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;Vertex, std::allocator&amp;lt;Vertex&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; took up 78.98% of my CPU time. But how, I wondered? Where am I calling this function that much? My &lt;code&gt;Mesh::Draw&lt;/code&gt; function simply instructs openGL to draw the VAO, it doesn&amp;#39;t copy vectors. But it wasn&amp;#39;t the draw function that was the issue. It was the for loop itself. Now for the &amp;quot;horror&amp;quot; part of the title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;It copied the mesh object, including all 18 megabytes of vertex data, every frame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain what happened to those who don&amp;#39;t know, in C++ values are copied by default. If I say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int a = 1;
int b = a;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then a and b both store the value 1, independently. The same is true of bigger objects, like my mesh object. So when I said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (auto mesh : meshes){
    mesh.Draw(shader);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what my compiler understood was essentially (in english code):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for each mesh:
    reserve memory space of size of mesh (which is ~18 MB)
    make local copy of mesh to that memory space
    call Draw() on the copy with argument shader
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One small adjustment later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (auto &amp;amp;mesh : meshes){
    mesh.Draw(shader);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and my compiler understands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for each mesh:
    call Draw() on that mesh with argument shader
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which was my intention to start with. But because I didn&amp;#39;t use the reference character &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, my compiler went with the default option of copying the value, which meant my CPU was spending each and every frame duplicating 18 megabytes. Reserving 18 megabytes of RAM was the biggest part of that step. All of it completely useless, since that data is a local variable to the for loop, which means it gets effectively removed again every cycle of the for loop, every frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the optimisation in place, my frame time was down to 0.0083 s per frame, capped to my monitor&amp;#39;s 120 FPS limit, an improvement of factor &amp;gt; 6, (and probably much much more, but my FPS cap doesn&amp;#39;t show that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more improvements I can make, of course. But this was the kind of problem I wasn&amp;#39;t even considering, since the languages I already knew used references by default. If you ever find yourself working in C++ for anything where performance matters, always check to see if you are using references where you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in another way, there is a bigger optimisation lesson here: I was trying to optimise manually. Don&amp;#39;t do that. If I was using a performance analyser from the start I wouldn&amp;#39;t have spent days working on functions that weren&amp;#39;t the problem in the first place. The problem wasn&amp;#39;t even any of my functions or methods, it was my syntax. &lt;strong&gt;Just because there is no syntax error doesn&amp;#39;t mean your syntax isn&amp;#39;t wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; It is tempting for new programmers to think they understand their own code. You don&amp;#39;t. Especially in bigger programs, it can become easily impossible to know what your program is struggling with, and what it doesn&amp;#39;t care about. Strings are such a thing that a computer finds far harder to use than you might expect. But knowing what things a computer finds hard, especially if you are working with custom data types or functions where you can&amp;#39;t google if it is fast or slow, is almost impossible to accurately predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my program was wasting dozens of milliseconds copying megabytes. But I was wasting days not using a performance analyser. Had I used it from the start, I would have understood that there was something very wrong with my for loop, and found the issue in an hour at most. Instead, I tried to optimise code I hadn&amp;#39;t measured and wasted my own time, which in a way is much more valuable than my program&amp;#39;s frame rate. Measure your program when you are having performance issues, take this lesson for free from someone who has learned it the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading through this wall of text, I hope it has been valuable or at least entertaining to you. If you have a similar learning experience or story with premature optimisation or wasteful copying, I would love to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,

I'm  a first year university student majoring in CS. Whenever I try to  make/develop an application or little program, I find myself constantly  searching up tutorials. I might have the wrong idea, but my idea of  being a good programmer is being able to code something up with little  help. So rarely having to look at tutorials, references, etc. Also, I  seem to forget programming languages. I program in one language for a  long period of time and when I switch back to the language I was using  before, I vaguely recall the syntax, topics (especially classes), etc.  So I have to spend time relearning the language, as well as how to build  the application I have in mind. I just want to know how you developed  your programming skills.

,learnprogramming,"Edited to be more specific.

I’m an academic who has strict legal requirements to keep my work and non-work online interactions very much separate due to legal regulations around working with children. Recently my workplace has instituted a bring your own device policy which has me concerned. Maybe 15% of my present job is programming or programming related.

I have a set of dot files and online logins that are provided by my work institution (think G-Suite and other such educational tools, printer and network share access, etc.) I have a separate set of dot files and online logins for my own personal projects outside of work (like this Reddit account), and a third set for professional work away from my institution (think conferences or journals or whatever that all of their own submission formats and tech requirements.)

Obviously, before I would just use two different machines but that isn’t an option now since we are moving to BYOD, and I simply have my personal MacBook.

I don’t want my employer (or students, for example) knowing I might be searching out other employment opportunities or putting together a portfolio, working on a zombie shooter in my spare time or whatever. You can imagine how jumpy people are about this type of thing causing issues in education, I’m sure.

I don't think running a bunch of VMs are good solution here. Yes, I’m prematurely worrying about cross contamination between these three very different domains.

&lt;p&gt;I’m an academic who has strict legal requirements to keep my work and non-work online interactions very much separate due to legal regulations around working with children. Recently my workplace has instituted a bring your own device policy which has me concerned. Maybe 15% of my present job is programming or programming related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a set of dot files and online logins that are provided by my work institution (think G-Suite and other such educational tools, printer and network share access, etc.) I have a separate set of dot files and online logins for my own personal projects outside of work (like this Reddit account), and a third set for professional work away from my institution (think conferences or journals or whatever that all of their own submission formats and tech requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, before I would just use two different machines but that isn’t an option now since we are moving to BYOD, and I simply have my personal MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want my employer (or students, for example) knowing I might be searching out other employment opportunities or putting together a portfolio, working on a zombie shooter in my spare time or whatever. You can imagine how jumpy people are about this type of thing causing issues in education, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think running a bunch of VMs are good solution here. Yes, I’m prematurely worrying about cross contamination between these three very different domains.

I am trying to send an array of random (positive and negative) ints to the method ""isEven""  from main. The goal is to search the array for negative and positive ints.

My ""random int generator"" is working fine and creates 10 random ints, and when I tested passing it to the method is worked fine. However, when I through recursion into the mix, it read an arrayIndexOutofBounds expectation.  I'm pretty stuck and am looking for some advice (aside from never using recursion again).

I think the issue may be how I am passing the array to the method? As when I set the ""is less than 0"" condition it creates an error because the array size cant every be less than 0. But, still, I am unsure about this.

in java there are maximum and minimum values for the primitive type int you can actually figure it out using this wrapper class\_\_  Integer.MIN\_VALUE\_\_\_\_  Integer.MAX\_VALUE  
the maximum number is 2147483647  
now when you try to declare a variable of type int and let's say give it the (max value+1)(manually) of the type int which is 2147483648 an error occurs...  
here's the code to be specific :   int max1 = 2147483648;

however if you use an operator to store that max value+1 the code works fine even though it overflows there is no error at all and here's what i mean :

int max1 = 2147483647+1;

,learnprogramming,"Problem:

I am looking to create a  function that takes a list of integers as one parameter and one integer as a second parameter. The function returns True if the difference between every adjacent pair of integers in the list produces a value equal to the second parameter (the integer). If there is any pair of adjacent integers in the list whose difference does not produce the second parameters as the result when they are subtracted (ignoring the sign), the function should return False.

,learnprogramming,"Hi all,

I'm trying to put together a series of courses/materials to learn programming, and am seeking advice/input on whether my choices are sufficient enough - or too tough - for a beginner.

I want to learn programming with foundations and theory in place as opposed to a compressed bootcamp-esque approach.

My main goal is to develop tools for my workplace, specifically to help with streamlining processes with our day to day workflows, with the eventual hopes of carving out a technology-based position for myself, managing our enterprise infrastructure, and leveraging that experience into a full time programming/coding position elsewhere.

From what I've read, CS50 seemed to be a frequently mentioned choice as a  good starting point. I would like to supplement this with some foundational courses from Berkeley's CS Program, namely CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ([https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)), and the 'How to Design Programs' text ([https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/index.html](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/index.html))

Finally, I'd like to learn Python as my starting language, and was wondering if attempting the O'Reilly 'Learning Python' text was a good idea for beginners such as my self.

Take this simple example where the game asks the user if he/she wants to play a new round. If the user doesn't press either ""y"" or ""n"" it asks again.   


How could it be written in a better and cleaner way than with a goto like this?

        Console.WriteLine(""Do you want to play a new round? y/n"");

,learnprogramming,"So just to preface this question: I am learning C right now and am proficient in Python, Java and Golang so I am not at all new to coding.

I have been using LeetCode to help me learn C and one thing I have seen is that my functions seem to be failing if I fail to mention one of the input parameters. Is it true that all parameters must be used in the function?

Here's an example of a function I am writing that is my answer to the LeetCode problem [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/):

    int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize){
        int* result = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
        *returnSize = 2; //line in question
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numsSize-1; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j &lt; numsSize; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                        result[0] = i;
                        result[1] = j;
                        break;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

As you can see, there is a parameter `int* returnSize` that is given but I didn't really have any need for it. If I submit the code in the code block above, everything works fine. If I then were to comment out the third line in the code block that contains `//line in question`, then it will give me the following error:

100004.8 + 0.3 = 100005.0

Any ideias on how to fix this ?

Function:

    void print_dec(struct opt *list, double first, double inc, double stop, char format[MAX_LENGTH], char sep[MAX_LENGTH]){
        //printf(""dec\n"");
        if(signal == -1){
            for(float i = first; i&gt;=stop; i = i + inc){
                printf(format,i);
                printf(""%s"",sep);
            }
        }
        else{
            for(float i = first; i&lt;=stop; i = i + inc){
                printf(format,i);
                printf(""%s"",sep);  
            }
        }
    }

,learnprogramming,"\[SOLVED\] - ""output"" did not end with `'\0'` so the output loop kept running. Thanks!

I'm writing a program in C for a course I'm taking, but there's one issue I can't wrap my head around.

I have a program in which the user provides a key (26 alphabetical characters, case-insensitive) and a string of input. The program then encrypts the input and returns the encrypted string. I have all of this done, but when my input length is 1, such as when the user enters ""a"" and the key is ""QWERTY...,"" the program returns something like ""qY+y""

I've fought with this for several hours now, and I can't see what's causing it.

The basic run-down of how I set this up:

    // get the key, test whether or not it is valid (alphabetical, length of 26)
    // store the key in char used_chars[26]
    // loop through the input and check that there're no duplicate letters
    // store the valid key as ""key""
    
    // get input from user and store it in a ""before"" variable
    
    // loop through the input and convert letters - only code I'll include here
    
    for (int i = 0, j = strlen(input); i &lt; j; i++)
    {
        int value = input[i];
    
        if (value &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 'z')
            value = key[input[i] - 97]; // setting a=0 ... z=26
    
        else if (value &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 'Z')
            value = key[input[i] - 65] - 32 // setting a=0, then a=A
    
        output[i] = value;
    }

Here's an example of output:

    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: This is a test
    after: Ziol ol q ztlz // CORRECT
    
    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: a
    after: qS^ // INCORRECT
    
    &gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    before: a
    after: qCkQ // CHANGES EVERY TIME

I can provide more details if needed, but I'm kind of at the end of my wits about this. Not to mention, it works just fine when I step through it in the debugger.

Thanks for reading, I hope I explained it well enough :)

before: This is a test
after: Ziol ol q ztlz // CORRECT

&amp;gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

after: qS^ // INCORRECT

&amp;gt; ./substitute qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
before: a
after: qCkQ // CHANGES EVERY TIME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can provide more details if needed, but I&amp;#39;m kind of at the end of my wits about this. Not to mention, it works just fine when I step through it in the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

I have this route

*const* userRequest = require('../graphqlRequest/user');

`router.post('/register', async (req, res) =&gt; {try {console.log(""client"", client)console.log(""userrequeest&gt;&gt;"",userRequest.findUser)`

`const hash = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10)const user = await userRequest.findUser(req.body.email);if(!user){console.log(""user not found"")}else {console.log(""user found"")// return user also exist}}catch (err) {console.log(""error has come"")res.send(400).status(""error"", err)}})`

This is clicnt.js

`const { GraphQLClient } = require('graphql-request');const client =() =&gt;{return new GraphQLClient('https://edu-2020.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql', {headers: {""x-hasura-admin-secret"": ""Salhotra1""// ""authorization"": ""Bearer "" + jwtToken},})}module.exports = {client}`

Here's userRequest code

`const findUser = async (email) =&gt;{console.log(""entered find user"",email)client.request(UserFind, {emailtocheck:email}).then(data =&gt; {console.log(data)return data;}).catch(err =&gt; {// GraphQL response errorsconsole.log(""there is error"")console.log(err.response.data) // Response data if available})}`

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i can see in console ""entered find user"" with correct email id.  But after that it leaves this code of block entirely and goes out and display`console.log(""error has come"")`

In my request api client I see 400 error with this error message

,learnprogramming,"Hey all,

I have a pretty tough one (in my opinion). I have a Golang function that parses a string using regex. The function is designed to edit and create comments. Here are two examples of comments that are parsed:

A)

    // EqualValues asserts that two objects are equal or convertable to the same types
    // and equal.
    //
    //    assert.EqualValues(t, uint32(123), int32(123))

B)

    // HTTPBodyContains asserts that a specified handler returns a
    // body that contains a string.
    //
    //  assert.HTTPBodyContains(t, myHandler, ""GET"", ""www.google.com"", nil, ""I'm Feeling Lucky"")
    //
    // Returns whether the assertion was successful (true) or not (false).

The following is the current expression, which ONLY works for example B: `\(((\(\)|[^)])+)\)`

I'm looking for an expression that would match the following:

From A:

    (t, uint32(123), int32(123))

As well as from B:

    (t, myHandler, ""GET"", ""www.google.com"", nil, ""I'm Feeling Lucky"")

Here's an example: [https://regexr.com/548te](https://regexr.com/548te)

&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty tough one (in my opinion). I have a Golang function that parses a string using regex. The function is designed to edit and create comments. Here are two examples of comments that are parsed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// EqualValues asserts that two objects are equal or convertable to the same types
// and equal.
//
//    assert.EqualValues(t, uint32(123), int32(123))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// HTTPBodyContains asserts that a specified handler returns a
// body that contains a string.
//
//  assert.HTTPBodyContains(t, myHandler, &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;www.google.com&amp;quot;, nil, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Feeling Lucky&amp;quot;)
//
// Returns whether the assertion was successful (true) or not (false).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is the current expression, which ONLY works for example B: &lt;code&gt;\(((\(\)|[^)])+)\)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for an expression that would match the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(t, uint32(123), int32(123))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as from B:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(t, myHandler, &amp;quot;GET&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;www.google.com&amp;quot;, nil, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Feeling Lucky&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

So I've been taking a free online course on both \*\*HTML\*\* and \*\*CSS\*\* so I could experiment with front-end development and understand if it is of my liking or not and I ended up learning a lot of things with it.

In this specific project I had to choose 1 out of 1 website main pages, in between which were websites like youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. I ended up choosing GitHub. The challenge here was to create a replica as loyal as possible to the professionally made website's main page.

During this course I learned a lot about different \*\*HTML tags\*\* that can be uses to build any website desired such as:

* HTML and Body Tag (&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;)
* Head tag and its elements: title, meta, and link tags: ( &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;meta&gt; &lt;link&gt; )
* Different div tags, and other specific elements like paragraphs, unordered lists, ordered lists, audio, video, hyperlinks, forms and form elements and span text elements.
* CSS styling rules ans specificity
* CSS media rules and mobile responsiveness
* Working with flex-box to display various elements.

Here is the list of questions and their answers in a few words. I'll link my article after for better formatting and way more details, but this way you can decide if it's worth reading for you:

1. **What programming language should I learn?** For a very general answer, go for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can make websites, mobile applications, software and games with them.
2. **What is the best way to learn programming?** Follow a good tutorial, then stop using tutorials entirely and do personal projects.
3. **Do I need to be good at maths to be good at programming?** No, except in some very special cases.
4. **Do I need a degree to learn programming?** No, but you have to be self-critical and keep in mind that you don't know what you don't know.
5. **Do I need a degree to get a software developer job?** It will be hard without one. You will lack some skills, but also you will compete with people that have a better profile for the same job offer.
6. **Sometimes I get stuck on a basic problem for hours, is it normal?** Yes, totally, I get stuck for hours on stupid issues all the time. Just make sure that you leverage those struggles to learn from them.
7. **Is programming hard to learn?** Yes, but it gets better, quickly.
8. **What tools should I use?** It doesn't matter.
9. **I use Google a lot and I feel like I’m cheating, is it bad?** No, quite the contrary. I use it a lot on the job, and you have to learn to use it early.

,learnprogramming,"Hello,

I've been trying to establish a connection from Android Studio to a MySQL database with Cloud SQL. Basically I setup the MySQL database to be hosted on Google Cloud SQL and then I used JDBC to connect Android Studio with it.

Using the exact same connection parameter, I was able to connect it using a regular IDE (IntelliJ IDEA). I was able to run multiple queries, getting and inserting data and it was updating perfectly.

However, trying to do the same in Android Studio is messing with my head. I'm getting this error:

&gt;`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure.`

&gt;`The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.`

So far here's what I've concluded/done:

* It's probably not a whitelisting issue

 * I checked what IP the emulator is using and it seems like when checking in browser it's using the host machine's address

* Emulator -&gt; cloud connection is correct

 * I changed the jdbc connection (using the wrong ip) and it outputted a different error

* It could be the cloud refusing the emulated Android device's connection

 * I disabled the whitelisted IP and then tried using my initial test code in IntelliJ IDEA and it gave me the same error as if I'm connecting using Android Studio with the whitelisted IP

* I've tried copying the JDBC string directly  from MySQLWorkbench

 * No difference in error message

* I've deleted and reimported the MySQL connector to Java. Its lack of was an error I encountered when testing in IDEA

Here's the code I'm using in AS to connect


    private void establishConnect()
    {
        try
        {
            Class.forName(""com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"");
            dbConnection  = DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:mysql:&lt;connection IP&gt;cloudSqlInstance=&lt;connection instance&gt;&amp;user=&lt;username&gt;"");
            Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, ""Connection successful"", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, ""An error occurred"" + e, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    }

If anyone has a solution, man I'd be forever grateful. Right now I'm ready to take a break and jump off a bridge.",t2_n5ynd,False,,0,False,Anyone have any experience with Android Studio and Google Cloud SQL connection?,[],r/learnprogramming,False,6,,0,False,t3_ggc9eo,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589044365.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnprogramming,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to establish a connection from Android Studio to a MySQL database with Cloud SQL. Basically I setup the MySQL database to be hosted on Google Cloud SQL and then I used JDBC to connect Android Studio with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the exact same connection parameter, I was able to connect it using a regular IDE (IntelliJ IDEA). I was able to run multiple queries, getting and inserting data and it was updating perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, trying to do the same in Android Studio is messing with my head. I&amp;#39;m getting this error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve concluded/done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably not a whitelisting issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I checked what IP the emulator is using and it seems like when checking in browser it&amp;#39;s using the host machine&amp;#39;s address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emulator -&amp;gt; cloud connection is correct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed the jdbc connection (using the wrong ip) and it outputted a different error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be the cloud refusing the emulated Android device&amp;#39;s connection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I disabled the whitelisted IP and then tried using my initial test code in IntelliJ IDEA and it gave me the same error as if I&amp;#39;m connecting using Android Studio with the whitelisted IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried copying the JDBC string directly  from MySQLWorkbench&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference in error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve deleted and reimported the MySQL connector to Java. Its lack of was an error I encountered when testing in IDEA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the code I&amp;#39;m using in AS to connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void establishConnect()
{
    try
    {
        Class.forName(&amp;quot;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver&amp;quot;);
        dbConnection  = DriverManager.getConnection(&amp;quot;jdbc:mysql:&amp;lt;connection IP&amp;gt;cloudSqlInstance=&amp;lt;connection instance&amp;gt;&amp;amp;user=&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;&amp;quot;);
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, &amp;quot;Connection successful&amp;quot;, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, &amp;quot;An error occurred&amp;quot; + e, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();

,learnprogramming,"All of the APIs I see just have simple lines like /products to get all products, or /products/6 to get the product with the id 6. This all makes sense to me, but I am making an API for my private web app and I am wondering how to account for users.

I currently have an endpoint for /users/&lt;id&gt; which gives a json of user information. I have an /auth/register and /auth/login, and all that seems fine to me. When I want to retrieve a ""product"" in this case, I am lost. Do I  do

    - GET /users/&lt;id&gt;/products/&lt;id&gt;
    OR
    - GET /products?user_id=&lt;id&gt;&amp;product_id=&lt;id&gt;

Also, if I have a ""users"" endpoint that returns a json, which includes all of the ""products"", should I also have a products endpoint that returns a list of products given a user id? That seems redundant to me.

    GET /users/&lt;id&gt;
    returns: json
    {
        ""id"": 4
        ""email"": ""email@email.com"",
        ""age"": 24,

I could just get the user and parse the products into a list of maps/dicts. Is it better practice to do this instead?

This all makes sense to me, but I am making an API for my private web app and I am wondering how to account for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have an endpoint for /users/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt; which gives a json of user information. I have an /auth/register and /auth/login, and all that seems fine to me. When I want to retrieve a &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; in this case, I am lost. Do I  do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- GET /users/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;/products/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;
OR
- GET /products?user_id=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;amp;product_id=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if I have a &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; endpoint that returns a json, which includes all of the &amp;quot;products&amp;quot;, should I also have a products endpoint that returns a list of products given a user id? That seems redundant to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;
returns: json
{
    &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 4
    &amp;quot;email&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;email@email.com&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;age&amp;quot;: 24,
    &amp;quot;products:
        [
            {
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: example,
                &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot;: 5.24
            }
            {
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: example2,
                &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot;: 3.24
            }
        ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could just get the user and parse the products into a list of maps/dicts. Is it better practice to do this instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /products?user_id=5
returns: json
{
    &amp;quot;products:
        [
            {

Now the function compares 'Michelangelo' to 'Raphael'.  
a.length - b.length now means 12 - 7, which equals 5.

,learnprogramming,"Coming in to Flatiron School, I was incredibly excited. I had committed myself to following my dream of becoming a UX Researcher and Designer (which was a big mental undertaking for me, truly going for what I knew I’d be good at, versus development where I “manage”). I couldn’t afford the tuition, and my credit wasn’t good enough for a loan or ISA program, so when I got a call on February 4th that I had been awarded a scholarship thanks to NexTech’s “100 Innovators in Tech” program, I couldn’t help but cry. I was a month from being homeless, my job search was going poorly (and I needed a new career direction). This was the Hail Mary that I thought was going to turn my life around.

With this scholarship, my family agreed to help me obtain an apartment in Denver and cover my rent during the program. This investment would end up being over $10,000.

Sadly, my health failed just as the cohort I was set to join got kicked off in early March. I alerted my instructors, and after several weeks it became apparent that I needed to defer to a later class. I did so. 

I had serious issues with the program during my first initial stint. Featuring disjointed materials, only 15 mins of weekly “face to face” time with your instructor when you’re expected to put in 30+ hours each week, educational coaches that don’t understand the material or the industry, weekly lectures that served as merely a recap and then an hour of clearing up all the confusion around the homework (they call this “learning through iteration”, but in the end it’s just stress for no reason and hours of wasted work). Regardless, I was eager to give the program another shot. 

Then Flatiron pulled the rug out, here is how things play out….

**April 1st**

I get an email at 9 A.M about my transfer, stating “If you do not reply by 9AM 04/02/2020, your case will be closed and you will be dismissed from the program.”  and “We will look for availability in the Full-Time Online UX/UI 04/04/20 If the cohort is full, we will look for space in the next available cohort 05/25/20.” 

I respond and let the team know that the 04/04/20 Cohort is good with me, and get an auto-response saying it may take them 48 hours to respond, but I could be dismissed for not responding by the next morning?! 

**April 2nd**

I get an email stating “Apologies for the confusion, the next available cohort is not 04/04/20. It is actually 05/04/20. Please let me know if you are still interested in transferring.” I respond that I will make this work.

**April 3rd**

I get an email stating “We have completed the transfer from the Denver Design UX/UI  05/25/2020 cohort. Unfortunetly, the 05/04/2020 cohort is no longer available since it hsa been merged with the 05/25/2020 cohort. You will join this cohort at the beginning of Phase 1 which stars on 05/25/2020.”

If you’re counting, this is third date I’m given in three days.

**April 15th**

I check in and student services tells me that I’m still enrolled. However, my question on who my instructors would be is dodged again.

**April 21st**

A post goes up on the Flatiron Blog [here](https://flatironschool.com/blog/covid-corporate-response), cancelling the UX/UI program. Apparently, this (and other options) had been under consideration for several weeks.

**April 22nd**

At 9 PM, an email is sent to students. We can transfer to another program, but mine also includes the line “I understand you were awarded the Cognizant NexTech 100 Scholarship and if you plan to proceed with transferring to a new program, we can assist you with being reviewed by our scholarship committee again and previous eligibility used to evaluate your scholarship award.”

I’m sorry? I was already awarded this scholarship, we invested thousands of dollars so I could have this opportunity, and you’re going to make me go through the approval process again? Leases were signed, plans established, this isn’t some side show in my life. Also, not even a phone call?

**April 23rd**

I’m destroyed. There’s a job guarantee attached to this program, I don’t have the funds to go to another bootcamp and at this point things are already looking bad economy wise. I scurry to get enrolled in the Software Program because I don’t know what else to do, and supposedly they pull all these strings to make this happen. It turns out that the Admissions team was informed THE DAY BEFORE that this was happening, and had no chance to form a response. By the way, that program they enrolled me in? It starts May 11th with an estimated 160 Hours of “pre-work”. 

So now not only is my life turned upside down, I have a little over 2 weeks to complete 4 weeks worth of pre-work that I was in no way prepared to start.

**April 24th-April 28th**

After taking the day, I realize how screwed up this is on Flatiron’s part. From how they’ve treated their own staff, to how they think we can just switch programs (I specifically wanted to move away from Development), to the handling of the scholarships. All of it is ridiculous.

On April 28th I manage to get on the phone with Cognizant, thinking surely since they had awarded these funds they would allow me to pursue a design program elsewhere. Flatiron couldn’t meet their obligations, why should we suffer as students? 

The result? Flatiron and Cognizant have a “special arrangement” for these scholarship funds, and my only option is to transfer courses. They refuse to release my scholarship funds so I can attend General Assembly or another program of my choice. 

**Consider other options, even for non UX programs**

At the end of the day, Flatiron certainly churns out students that get jobs. But the real ask here is, are you comfortable giving your money and time to a company that will behave in this manner? That will treat staff and students alike with such little regard? That would take someone who is already in one of the most vulnerable positions of their life, see that their actions are causing immense pain and financial disruption, and walk away without a second thought?

**They still don't have it together**

Even after going rounds with the admin staff and letting them know I'm not backing down from my claims, they still haven't even taken the time to update their system to reflect that I'm no longer a student. As of today May 8th, I'm still receiving emails about joining the slack channel for the Software Engineering Cohort starting next week.

Is anyone here not in a stimulant or has experience with quitting them that can give me just a quick hello or words of inspiration? I know I can do this but in many ways scared to try. Scared of the pressure I put on myself. Out in the job market everyone is on it. Will I be ok? Can I still be great? Thanks for tuning in :)&lt;/p&gt;

Hope you all are doing well during this time.

So, just some background about my self: I am an undergraduate final semester Business Administration student with no CS/Programming/Coding knowledge. I am not at all a computer science person, in fact get that panic feel whenever I see someone programming lol. Jokes apart, I aim to get into project management career down the road and figured that a good project manager needs to understand the basics of programming to be able to make sense of what the development teams are doing. So, I decided to use this free time to develop CS/Programming knowledge and skills.

But one of my biggest weaknesses is mathematics!!!!! I can't describe enough hahahha. I failed basic calculus university course two times before barely passing it on the 3rd time.. So, you know how bad I am. Its not that I am bad at basic stuff like general algebra. I find myself pretty good at the basic math, but when it comes to the other stuff like trigno/calculus/linear algebra etc etc is where I start having panics lol. Its just not my piece of cake. With this weakness, I am not really sure if learning the CS/Programming stuff is realistic or not because my friends say that one needs to be decent at maths to understand programming. Any recommendations on where to get started learning? I read that the CS 50 course is a great course for someone like me who wants to get started. Is this true? Any other relevant info is welcomed!

I considered asking at r/GameDev, but their guidelines explicitly state not to ask questions like this there. I also checked through the FAQ and didn't see this explicit question asked.

I'm extremely passionate about video games and have been hoping to turn that into something I could do professionally. I also have a very logical/mathematical mindset, so it seemed like Video Game Programming was a great thing to look into pursuing. The problem I'm running into is that most online courses I've been able to find follow not only the programming aspect of making games (which I've been quite enjoying so far), but they go deep into the visual design elements as well, in terms of placing and manipulating actors, importing and creating materials/textures, meshes, etc.

The problem is that I don't really have the creative mindset that lends itself well to the design elements of making games. Anytime a lesson starts delving into these elements, my brain begins to lose all focus. So my question is this: is there a good way (like an online course perhaps) that focuses almost completely on the programming/coding aspects of game design without going in depth with the visual design elements? Is that even a viable career path for me to follow?

So when the destructor gets invoked, it tries to free both objects, but `m3` is  just the exact same as `m1`, that was already deallocated, so I get a segmentation fault.

What am I doing wrong? Obviously, I'm trying to create a COPY of `m1`, not just a reference.

**EDIT**: I fixed the copy constructor, but arithmetic operators are still not working. I have updated my code: [main.cpp](https://pastebin.com/44f6NzW4) | [Matrix.hpp](https://pastebin.com/nbPNqkfV) | [random\_t.hpp](https://pastebin.com/NXhGT2hm).",t2_aq66t7t,False,,0,False,Copy constructor &amp; destructor with a template class.,[],r/learnprogramming,False,6,topic,0,False,t3_gfykol,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},C++,False,2,,False,,1589021151.0,,[],{},,True,,1588991167.0,text,6,,,text,self.learnprogramming,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to make a class that recreates matrices, overloading the basic operators and manually managing the heap. &lt;a href=""https://pastebin.com/aD8TucTk""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s the &lt;strong&gt;main.cpp&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://pastebin.com/gYD1aaxb""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s the &lt;strong&gt;class.hpp&lt;/strong&gt;.

So I ended up with Atom everything was going fine as I was just messing with Conky and trying to customize it on my desire . I wanted to try something different and I went to add a C &amp; C++ compiler and I had no luck. The one with the most downloads and shown on internet was update 4 years ago

,learnprogramming,"Recently I wanted to start digging into the code of a game called RimWorld. I decompiled the source code and started looking through it, only to realize that basically all object defintions seem to be done through XML. I don't believe I've seen a single `Thing t = new Thing();`, but instead all the data for objects like hitpoints, name, description, label, etc. are stored within XML tags, and the decompiled source code somehow connects this data in a way to just execute the logic.

After looking around a bit more it seems that people have said the game uses reflection to define these objects at runtime. I work as a junior C# dev (ASP.NET) but I am fairly certain I have never used reflection in any way before so I'm pretty curious about how this works. Upon looking up some of the base level articles about reflection particularly [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_reflection.htm) and [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/593881/What-is-the-difference-between-2), I still just feel like I'm not quite grasping the concept fully. To me this seems like a completely different concept from the XML definitions I was looking at, I'm not sure how these things relate at all.

I guess this is a very vague topic so I'll try to give some specific questions, but I really just want to learn more about this methodology that RimWorld uses.

* What is the benefit (and drawbacks) of defining your objects via XML and having them defined at runtime? Over just declaring them as objects in C# code as one normally would? To me it seems more modular with cleaner separation, but I can't see any real benefit beyond that.
* How does this data actually get ""connected""? I understand that the XML tags have matching names to the properties of each of these classes, but I feel like I'm missing a step in the middle. How are XML objects mapped to C# objects? Is it just via an XML reader converting the data? I notice all of the classes look pretty normal without any weird XML stuff so I'm guessing there's some place in the code that this is all being handled.
* I guess I'm having trouble grasping how it actually executes in order. It's obvious normally, Object x is declared and defined, which then calls x.Method(), and then that does some logic which returns a value. But when these are dynamically defined at runtime, how is it ensured that everything is defined? For example if you call x.Method(), how do you ensure x is defined, or any of the variables within x are defined to calculate the result of Method? Do they just define all of these in mass at the beginning, and then move into code execution after all of the XML has been handled?

Previously, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dzeza7/i_made_a_learning_guide_to_help_people_become/) a guide to [learn programmming](https://electrichive.github.io/waggle-dance-programming-guide/) that got some traction. For the past few years, using this guide and other materials, we have been building a group that mentors people from all walks of life (including some I met through this subreddit) to become programmers.

This mentoring is and will always be provided free-of-charge, no strings attached. Our only ask is that we request members to make the following pledges:

* I pledge to help make the world a better place.
* I pledge to help mentor budding programmers become socially-conscious hackers.
* I pledge to help create technological solutions for public good.

This is our way of giving back to the programming community and the world, and we're now looking to expand our impact with Reddit's help.

Sounds good? Great! So, how do you get involved? Well, we're looking for more mentees, more mentors, and more members.

* If you want to join our community:
  * Join our [Zulip chat](https://electrichive.zulipchat.com/join/1sd9telza4kr8ckgmfse779b/) (Zulip is an open-source Slack alternative)

I've been trying to learn programming for a while now but with it I've been hammering my head on the wall due to your usual ""newbie"" problem of ""Is this language actually right for me?"" and I've dropped down into it myself while thinking ""Hah! That will never happen to me!"" but I was naive on this one.

I initially began my journey learning Lua with hopes to use Love2D framework to make small games, and so yes that is my plan to learn programming. To create games, but not huge AAA wannabe titles, I just wish to create something small to express my mind but then I stopped due to losing my motivation. When I returned I went back to Go and it was rather amazing thing to learn, the language while very verbose it felt easy to learn but is Go a language that I can accomplish my task? It felt like it with the frameworks available etc Pixel and so on. 

I've tried to explore python due to popular suggestion that every new wannabe programmer should learn it but... I just can't focus while learning it? It doesn't feel the same as learning Golang. It feels bland and boring and I miss the entertainment out of it but I've realised that Golang itself is probably the worst idea to try making small indie games in. 

Would anyone suggest my course of action? Maybe a language that is worth checking out for something that I'm hoping to accomplish? Do you think Golang can actually be used for small game developments?

,learnprogramming,"Hello so I'm hoping this is a unique case and not a repeated question.

I'm currently serving in the military as part national service, and I only have access to the shared computers in the computer room.

I am not supposed to download or install anything on these computers, but i want to continue learning programming.I enjoyed some of Codecademy's free courses because I can actually apply the coding I learn on their platform without having to install anything. (I can actually ""practice"" not just ""study"")

Is it worth it for me to get Codecademy Pro? OR are there better alternatives? I'm here for another year.
